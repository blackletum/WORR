# WORR SWOT and Task-Based Feature + Development Roadmaps

Date: 2026-02-27

## Purpose
Create a repository-grounded SWOT and convert it into actionable, task-based project roadmaps that can guide coordinated team execution.

## Status Updates
- `FR-02-T09` / `FR-02-T10` / `FR-02-T11` / `DV-02-T06` / `DV-07-T05` Done:
  - Added a renderer-neutral shadow frontend contract (`shadow_light_desc_t`, `shadow_view_desc_t`, `shadow_caster_t`, `shadow_cache_key_t`, `shadow_page_id_t`, `shadow_backend_ops_t`) shared by GL, native Vulkan, and RTX builds.
  - Wired GL and native Vulkan frame paths into the shared frontend for deterministic candidate light selection, backend-resolved caster bounds, per-view caster index spans, light-influence cluster dirtying, page residency keys, dirty reasons, freeze modes, optional sun cascade descriptors, and main-view visibility mutation guardrails.
  - Implemented native OpenGL depth and moment array page allocation, per-layer shadow rendering, moment mip generation, `ShadowPages` UBO upload, and hard/PCF/PCSS/VSM/EVSM receiver sampling in the dynamic shader path.
  - Implemented native Vulkan depth and moment array page allocation, per-layer render pass/framebuffer setup, explicit depth/moment image barriers, optional moment mip generation, shadow descriptor binding, and world receiver sampling in the embedded Vulkan world shader.
    - Replaced interim caster-box rendering with actual brush, MD2/alias, and MD5 skeletal caster geometry for both non-RTX backends; GL keeps CPU shadow copies of uploaded model buffers, while Vulkan emits caster triangles through a native entity callback.
    - Fixed first-person entity caster visibility by marking the local body clone as `RF_CASTSHADOW`, excluding `RF_WEAPONMODEL` view weapons from the caster list, and emitting model-less `RF_CASTSHADOW` bounds proxies in both non-RTX backends.
    - Hardened transient visual no-cast behavior so particles, projectile models, and explosion models are marked or rejected before entering shared shadow caster collection.
    - Completed authored entity shadowlight handling for point and spot `light`/`dynamic_light` records across cgame, client, server setup, shared frontend area/PVS2 culling, wide-spot caster influence testing, and 64-bit receiver light masks.
    - Fitted sun cascades to camera frustum splits with texel-snapped light-space origins, and aligned Vulkan receiver normal-offset bias behavior with OpenGL.
  - Added focused shadow dumps, materialization reports, live debug overlays, model-path caster exclusion, tracked/configstring shadowlight metadata preservation, world-occluder view culling, and scripted repro smoke launch coverage.
  - Added `sv_shadow_strict_replication` for multiplayer servers that prefer strict normal-PVS shadow owner replication over the default PVS2 shadow relevance expansion.
  - Added a CI/source guardrail script that blocks the removed no-slot fallback and sticky slot-churn shadow cvars/paths from returning.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/renderer/shadowmapping-replacement-baseline.md`, `docs-dev/renderer/shadowmapping-native-backends-2026-04-30.md`, `docs-dev/renderer/shadowmapping-full-plan-2026-04-30.md`.
- `FR-03-T09` Done:
  - Added shared archived `r_borderless` tri-state window behavior for renderer/video backends (`0` exclusive where supported, `1` borderless fullscreen, `2` always borderless in windowed mode too).
  - Updated the Video and Multi-Monitor menu selectors to expose `r_borderless` instead of the legacy `r_fullscreen_exclusive` toggle, while keeping the legacy cvar as a no-archive runtime mirror.
  - Aligned the bootstrap session shell with `r_borderless` so startup window mode resolution matches the engine's renderer window policy.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/shared-borderless-cvar-2026-04-29.md`.
- `FR-04-T08` Done:
  - Added a Quake Champions-inspired top HUD for cgame multiplayer modes, covering FFA leader/chaser rows, team score panels, duel player panels, match timer, time limit, warmup/countdown, timeout, overtime, and intermission states.
  - Extended the sgame HUD blob with match metadata and optional scoreboard-row health/armor vitals so spectator duel panels can show player resources without changing legacy layout compatibility.
  - Refined the warmup timer to match the QC state/clock/timelimit stack, made FFA row selection mirror the existing minihud's top-two-or-viewed-player behavior, and serialized row rank/name data so top rows do not fall back to generic labels.
  - Fixed a screenshot-validation crash by draining renderer-owned async callbacks before external renderer shutdown/unload.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/quake-champions-top-hud-2026-04-28.md`, `docs-dev/renderer-async-shutdown-drain-2026-04-29.md`.
- `DV-02-T02` In Progress:
  - Nightly Linux/macOS jobs now install explicit Vulkan toolchain dependencies so renderer artifacts do not depend on hosted-image luck.
  - Windows MSYS2 nightlies/releases now install Vulkan headers/loader plus `glslangValidator` so Vulkan/RTX renderer artifacts build in CI.
  - The macOS Intel target now uses the supported `macos-15-intel` runner label instead of the retired `macos-13` label.
  - Linux nightly dependency names were updated for current Ubuntu runner images (`libdecoration0-dev`, no `libsdl3-dev` requirement under Meson fallback).
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/macos-nightly-vulkan-support-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23146195642` by fixing MSYS2/C++20 client compatibility issues (`min`/`max` typing, non-debug `developer` usage), the RTX debug symbol linkage mismatch, and the MinGW Unicode updater entry-point path.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/msys2-nightly-build-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23148759868` by fixing three cross-platform CI regressions:
    - renamed repository version metadata from `VERSION` to `WORR_VERSION` so macOS case-insensitive filesystems no longer shadow libc++ `<version>`
    - replaced non-portable `std::sinf` usage in `sgame` with standard `std::sin` overloads so GCC/Linux builds complete
    - fixed WiX MSI generation by removing self-referential preprocessor defines, adding the required Product language, and hard-failing on `heat`/`candle`/`light` native command errors
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-ci-cross-platform-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23152001787` by fixing three follow-up CI regressions:
    - changed the WiX PowerShell wrapper to pass explicit native argument arrays so switches like `-out` are not consumed as PowerShell parameters
    - restored the Linux nightly OpenGL header dependency with `libgl1-mesa-dev`
    - replaced `std::from_chars(float)` with portable strict `std::strtof` parsing in `sgame` command and sky-rotation paths for macOS libc++
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23152001787-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23153597827` by fixing another three-platform nightly regression set:
    - emitted explicit x64 WiX harvest/compile metadata so Windows MSI validation no longer trips `ICE80`
    - updated RTX debug line-rasterization setup to the current Vulkan `EXT` symbols used by hosted Linux headers
    - made `sgame` save metadata/serialization handle `size_t` cleanly with JsonCpp-facing explicit widths for macOS builds
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23153597827-error-warning-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23156641291` by fixing the Unix release-pack staging collision with the root `worr` executable and restoring GCC-compatible `q_unused` placement in `rend_gl`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23156641291-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23159773990` / job `67284227517` by converting the remaining RTX line-rasterization negotiation path in `src/rend_rtx/vkpt/main.c` from `KHR` to `EXT`, matching the Vulkan headers used on current Linux CI runners.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23159773990-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered run `23162552895` / job `67293973244` by fixing GCC/Linux-incompatible temporary `VEC2`/`VEC3` client callsites, keeping the C-only `-Wmissing-prototypes` warning path out of C++ engine targets, and hardening Linux validation-path issues in BSP patched-PVS path construction, zone stats printing, MVD multicast leaf handling, and OpenAL loader loop indexing.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23162552895-linux-safety-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
- `DV-04-T03` In Progress:
  - Recovered run `23153597827` by fixing three additional cross-platform failures:
    - emitted explicit x64 WiX harvest/compile metadata so Windows MSI validation no longer trips `ICE80`
    - updated RTX debug line-rasterization setup to the current Vulkan `EXT` symbols used by hosted Linux headers
    - made `sgame` save metadata/serialization handle `size_t` cleanly with JsonCpp-facing explicit widths for macOS builds
  - Removed first-party warning categories surfaced by the same run across `client`, `cgame`, `sgame`, `rend_gl`, and `rend_vk`, and reduced fallback dependency warning noise by quieting forced-fallback third-party builds and disabling HarfBuzz subproject tests in CI configure steps.
  - Aligned project-wide linker arguments for both C and C++ Meson targets so local Windows validation of the client executable uses the same linker configuration as the other binaries.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23153597827-error-warning-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
  - Recovered additional warning noise from run `23156641291` by removing `entity_iterable_t` constructor template-id syntax in `sgame` and extending quiet fallback warning suppression for third-party fallback builds.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-run-23156641291-recovery-2026-03-16.md`.
- `FR-02-T08` Done:
  - Hardened the OpenGL `q2dm1` launch path so unsupported postfx framebuffer combinations retry safer bloom/DOF/depth variants instead of failing the whole postfx chain on `GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED`.
  - Removed two false-positive startup warnings from the same smoke path by scoping map-fix validation to entities that actually need model data and suppressing `PF_Client_Print` free/zombie noise during `ss_loading`.
  - Added a client-side guard so sound-only frames do not call `CL_CalcViewValues` before cgame entity extensions are available.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/renderer-startup-log-cleanup-2026-03-27.md`.
- `FR-03-T08` In Progress:
  - Tightened multiplayer menu routing so the match menu is only selected during an active multiplayer game session, instead of any `cl.maxclients > 1` state.
  - Split the session-only menu definitions (`dm_welcome`, `dm_join`, `join`, `dm_hostinfo`, `dm_matchinfo`) out of `src/game/cgame/ui/worr.json` into a dedicated embedded `src/game/cgame/ui/worr-multiplayer.json` asset loaded by cgame UI init.
  - Added a cgame-side session helper exposed through the UI access boundary so the menu module no longer depends on broad engine-state assumptions for multiplayer routing.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/match-menu-session-split-2026-03-23.md`.
  - Converted the multiplayer `MyMap` entry into a dedicated submenu flow with explicit availability/status messaging, preserved flag state across navigation, and successful queue cleanup/close behavior.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/match-menu-mymap-submenu-2026-03-23.md`.
- `FR-02-T07` Done:
  - SDL video backend now creates Vulkan-capable windows for `r_renderer vulkan`/`rtx` instead of always forcing an OpenGL context.
  - Native Vulkan renderer now uses SDL Vulkan instance/surface helpers and enables portability enumeration/subset support required by MoltenVK-backed macOS devices.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/macos-nightly-vulkan-support-2026-03-16.md`.
- `FR-02-T03` Done:
  - User-facing launch/debug presets stay on `worr_x86_64(.exe)` and `worr_ded_x86_64(.exe)`, which are now bootstrap hosts that load `worr_engine_*` and `worr_ded_engine_*` in-process.
  - The short-lived explicit `worr_launcher_*` split was removed so the published binary names match the actual user launch path again.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/bootstrap-hosted-engine-libraries-2026-03-24.md`, `docs-dev/vscode-bootstrap-debug-presets-2026-03-24.md`.
- `DV-08-T05` Done:
  - Nightly/stable staging now packages the canonical repo `assets/` tree directly into `.install/basew/pak0.pkz`.
  - Loose staged asset duplication between `assets/` and `.install/` was removed so runtime assets now have a single authored source and a single packaged staging form.
  - Client/server release archives now use explicit payload filters instead of packaging identical full `.install/` trees.
  - Artifact verification now validates manifest contents so role-specific payload regressions are caught before publish.
  - Stable release packaging now reuses the same platform-packaging path as nightlies.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/basew-gamedir-and-arch-runtime-layout-2026-03-16.md`.
- `DV-08-T06` Done:
  - Local staging, release archives, and the Windows MSI now use a single `basew/` gamedir instead of the earlier `baseq2/` + `worr/` split.
  - Release CI now builds with `-Dbase-game=basew -Ddefault-game=basew`, and gameplay/runtime defaults now resolve the WORR payload through `basew`.
  - `WORR_VERSION` remains `0.1.0`, and the stable release workflow still publishes cross-platform GitHub releases from that semver source of truth.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/basew-gamedir-and-arch-runtime-layout-2026-03-16.md`.
- `DV-08-T07` Done:
  - User-facing bootstrap executables now ship with explicit arch suffixes such as `worr_x86_64(.exe)`, `worr_ded_x86_64(.exe)`, and `worr_updater_x86_64.exe`.
  - Hosted engine libraries now follow the same arch-suffixed rule (`worr_engine_x86_64`, `worr_ded_engine_x86_64`), while game DLLs continue using `cgame_x86_64` and `sgame_x86_64`.
  - Release manifests and updater metadata now publish the launcher/engine pairing through `launch_exe` and `engine_library`.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/basew-gamedir-and-arch-runtime-layout-2026-03-16.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-hosted-engine-libraries-2026-03-24.md`.
- `DV-08-T08` Done:
  - Nightly GitHub releases now publish as standard releases instead of GitHub prereleases.
  - Updater release discovery now filters the full GitHub release list by channel/tag and `allow_prerelease` policy, so stable installs do not drift onto nightly releases after that publishing change.
  - Nightly packaging no longer emits updater configs with `allow_prerelease=true`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/nightly-release-non-prerelease-channel-selection-2026-03-16.md`.
- `FR-08-T04` Done:
  - Release metadata now publishes an explicit role-level updater contract through the release index instead of inferring package names inside the updater.
  - `worr_update.json` now points at a channel-specific release index asset, and updater discovery resolves role payloads from that index before fetching the remote manifest.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/desktop-bootstrap-updater-2026-03-23.md`.
- `DV-03-T06` Done:
  - Added release-tool SemVer ordering tests covering stable, prerelease, and nightly version strings.
  - Added release-index parser tests for missing role metadata and malformed payload fields.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/desktop-bootstrap-updater-2026-03-23.md`.
- `DV-08-T01` Done:
  - Added release-index parser fixtures for missing role payloads and missing required updater metadata.
  - Added target-contract tests that keep full-install updater payload coverage separate from split manual archive coverage.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/desktop-bootstrap-updater-2026-03-23.md`.
- `DV-08-T03` In Progress:
  - The new bootstrap apply worker now verifies staged file hashes, writes the local install manifest last, and restores backed-up files on failure.
  - Local build/package validation passed, but explicit live fault-injection coverage for failed extraction/apply paths is still pending.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/desktop-bootstrap-updater-2026-03-23.md`.
- `DV-08-T09` Done:
  - Desktop updater startup remains bootstrap-based on Windows, Linux, and macOS, with the client using a branded splash and the dedicated server using a console-first updater flow.
  - Normal startup now stays inside the user-facing bootstrap executables, which host the engine shared libraries in-process; the temp updater worker is reserved for approved file-replacement/update paths and relaunches the public bootstrap after a successful update.
  - Update prompts can now be deferred without forcing an exit, and `autolaunch` is respected after worker-applied installs.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/desktop-bootstrap-updater-2026-03-23.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-hosted-engine-libraries-2026-03-24.md`.
- `DV-08-T11` Done:
  - Re-audited the updater pipeline against packaged artifacts, role-scoped staged installs, and local pending-update payloads.
  - Kept install-root normalization and real apply-time permission handling hardening in the bootstrap worker, added trace instrumentation plus a native Windows dedicated-server temp-worker/relaunch handoff path, closed the local Windows public-bootstrap approved-update gap, and added `tools/release/server_bootstrap_update_smoke.py` for deterministic local validation.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/updater-pipeline-audit-2026-03-25.md`.
- `DV-08-T12` In Progress:
  - Analyzed the local Steam-distributed Quake Champions client install and confirmed that Steam owns build/depot updates while the game behaves like a branded session shell with embedded web/session components.
  - Refactored the desktop bootstrapper toward a session-shell model by introducing explicit install-sync planning, enabling same-version repair/synchronization decisions, and constraining removals to managed files tracked by the local install manifest.
  - The worker/apply path can now complete metadata-only syncs without downloading a package, and local validation repaired a deliberately missing dedicated engine DLL through the public bootstrap update flow.
  - Added a Windows client shared-window handoff slice so the hosted engine can adopt the bootstrap-owned splash window instead of creating a second native client window on that path.
  - Added an in-process client sync/apply path so approved client synchronization can stay in the launcher, restore managed files, and enter the hosted engine in the same bootstrap-owned window when the running bootstrap executable itself is not being replaced.
  - Replaced the old fixed-size placeholder splash with a display-profile-driven SDL3 session shell that resolves `r_geometry`, `r_fullscreen`, `r_borderless`, legacy `r_fullscreen_exclusive`, `r_monitor_mode`, `r_display`, `autoexec.cfg`, and forwarded `+set` overrides before creating the client window.
  - The bootstrap now creates the client shell through SDL3's hidden property-based window path, applies the real fullscreen/window mode before showing it, and logs the resolved session-shell mode for validation.
  - Extended `tools/release/client_bootstrap_sync_smoke.py` so local validation can assert both the in-process repair/sync handoff and the expected bootstrap session-shell window mode.
  - The bootstrap splash now renders text through SDL3_ttf first, uses readable 12-16 px legal fine print, shortens the no-update splash dwell, disables Windows shared-HWND handoff so Win11 thumbnails/PrintScreen sample the renderer-owned engine window, keeps the transient splash out of the taskbar preview surface, routes fullscreen through `r_borderless 1` by default, clears the renderer-owned backbuffer under non-transparent menus, and consumes the startup transition marker as a one-shot so stale bootstrap frames cannot reappear behind the main menu.
  - Implementation logs: `docs-dev/client-bootstrap-session-shell-architecture-2026-03-25.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-session-shell-sync-refactor-2026-03-25.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-windows-client-shared-window-adoption-2026-03-25.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-client-in-process-sync-handoff-2026-03-25.md`, `docs-dev/bootstrap-session-shell-display-profile-window-creation-2026-03-25.md`, `docs-dev/ui-bootstrap-font-handoff-2026-04-27.md`, `docs-dev/shared-borderless-cvar-2026-04-29.md`.
- `DV-08-T10` Done:
  - Repaired the tracked vendored libcurl wrap patch so bootstrap-enabled local Windows builds now succeed against the `curl-8.18.0` fallback instead of failing on stale 8.15-era source paths.
  - Fixed the bootstrap updater's Windows `min`/`max` macro collision so the launcher/worker binaries compile cleanly with the vendored fallback enabled.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/libcurl-wrap-bootstrap-build-fix-2026-03-23.md`.
- `FR-01-T04` In Progress:
  - Completed Vulkan MD5 parity follow-up for frame resolve semantics and MD2/MD5 opaque-vs-alpha routing in `src/rend_vk/vk_entity.c`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/vulkan-md5-mesh-frame-alpha-parity-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Completed Vulkan MD5 `.md5scale` + scale-position parity and MD5 skin-routing correction in `src/rend_vk/vk_entity.c`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/vulkan-md5-mesh-parity-revision-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Fixed Vulkan sky re-registration crash on same-map reload (`VK_World_SetSky` handle invalidation ordering) in `src/rend_vk/vk_world.c`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/vulkan-sky-reregister-crash-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Aligned Vulkan MD2 mesh decode topology handling with RTX/GL remap behavior in `src/rend_vk/vk_entity.c`:
    - Skip invalid triangles instead of hard-failing the whole model.
    - Remap/deduplicate MD2 vertices by `(index_xyz, st.s, st.t)` and emit compact index/vertex streams.
    - Added MD2 header/frame-size/skin-dimension bounds checks matching RTX-style validation.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/vulkan-md2-mesh-remap-parity-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T01` In Progress:
  - Fixed OpenAL loop-merge channel reuse so merged loops cannot reuse `no_merge` Doppler channels in `src/client/sound/al.cpp`.
  - This preserves projectile world-origin tracking for Doppler-marked loop sounds when mixed with non-Doppler loops using the same sample.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-projectile-doppler-origin-merge-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Fixed q2proto entity delta application so loop extension fields are applied in `src/client/parse.cpp`:
    - `Q2P_ESD_LOOP_VOLUME`
    - `Q2P_ESD_LOOP_ATTENUATION`
  - This prevents stale `loop_attenuation` states (for example `ATTN_LOOP_NONE`) from producing level-wide/full-volume projectile loops after entity reuse.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-projectile-loop-attenuation-parse-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Fixed OpenAL EAX spatial routing consistency in `src/client/sound/al.cpp`:
    - Non-merged channels now run the same per-source spatial effect update path used by merged loops (direct filter, air absorption, and auxiliary send updates).
    - EAX zone selection now uses uncapped nearest-zone matching (`FLT_MAX` + squared-distance checks), eliminating the hard 8192-unit selection ceiling and reducing unnecessary LOS traces.
    - EAX effect application now clears stale AL error state before property updates for reliable success/failure reporting.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-eax-spatial-awareness-fixes-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Closed remaining EAX spatial-awareness gaps:
    - Restored real occlusion behavior in `src/client/sound/main.cpp` (`S_ComputeOcclusion`, `S_GetOcclusion`, `S_SmoothOcclusion`, `S_MapOcclusion`) with multi-ray tracing, material/transparency weighting, query rate limiting, and smoothing.
    - Replaced center-only LOS zone validation with multi-probe reachability checks in `src/client/sound/al.cpp` to reduce false zone misses in occluded/non-convex spaces.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-eax-spatial-gap-closure-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Fixed excessive projectile loop attenuation fallback in shared client sound:
    - Added `S_GetEntityLoopDistMult(const entity_state_t *ent)` in `src/client/sound/main.cpp`.
    - For projectile-like/doppler loops with unset `loop_attenuation` (`== 0`), fallback now uses `ATTN_NORM` before conversion to distance multiplier.
    - This applies to both OpenAL and DMA loop paths through the shared `S_GetEntityLoopDistMult(...)` call sites.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-projectile-loop-attenuation-fallback-fix-2026-02-27.md`.
  - Stabilized dense OpenAL Doppler loop mixes in `src/client/sound/al.cpp` for Issue #761:
    - Doppler-preserved same-sample loop groups now apply `1 / sqrt(count)` gain normalization instead of stacking full gain linearly.
    - Unmerged projectile/autosound loops now use a stable per-entity phase offset so identical loop samples do not all start in lockstep.
    - This reduces crackle/noise when many projectile loop emitters are active simultaneously while preserving per-entity Doppler spatialization.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-eax-loop-doppler-mix-stability-2026-03-22.md`.
  - Fixed clear-path explosion and held hand grenade tick regressions:
    - OpenAL source-path damping now skips occlusion floors/HF ceilings when the direct multi-ray path is still inside `S_OCCLUSION_CLEAR_MARGIN`, so visible midair explosions are not muffled by room-path classification alone.
    - Held throwable loop setup now mirrors primed sounds onto the player entity loop state immediately, and hand grenades emit a first tick cue while the loop carries the continuing fuse sound for the owner and nearby players.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/audio-clear-path-explosions-and-grenade-tick-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T06` Done:
  - Implemented the first spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Defaulted occlusion, EFX reverb, per-source reverb sends, air absorption, and HRTF default/autodetect toward the modern spatial path.
    - Decoupled OpenAL auxiliary reverb sends from `al_eax` so `al_reverb` is the routing master and authored EAX zones are optional overrides.
    - Reconnected automatic BSP reverb environment selection and added a compiled-in fallback table for missing `sound/default.environments`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-first-wave-consolidation-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T07` Done:
  - Implemented the second spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Replaced the direct substring occlusion classifier with a `.mat` ID keyed acoustic material resolver.
    - Converted the existing material families into low/mid/high transmission, absorption, scattering, and semantic flag profiles.
    - Routed resolved acoustic coefficients through direct gain, per-source HF filtering, and material-coloured reverb sends for OpenAL; kept DMA loop/channel state coherent with the shared resolver.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-acoustic-material-resolver-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T08` Done:
  - Implemented the third spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Added an OpenAL BSP acoustic region cache keyed by BSP area, built from leaf bounds, leaf faces, `.mat` material groups, sky exposure, and areaportal neighbours.
    - Replaced floor-first automatic reverb preset selection with a weighted listener-space resolver using region material composition, live dimension probes, sky ratio, vertical openness, portal openness, and floor material as a secondary signal.
    - Added source/listener region classification to per-source and merged-loop reverb sends so interior/exterior and cross-area sources get region-aware send gain and HF colour.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-bsp-acoustic-regions-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T09` Done:
  - Implemented the fourth spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Added a lightweight OpenAL portal propagation fallback that searches one- and two-hop BSP areaportal neighbour routes after direct multi-ray occlusion.
    - Evaluates route distance, bend penalty, aperture/openness penalty, and acoustic material transmission to estimate indirect direct-path audibility.
    - Applies valid portal routes to reduce over-occlusion, raise direct HF cutoff where appropriate, and colour/boost reverb sends for sources heard through neighbouring spaces.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-portal-propagation-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T10` Done:
  - Implemented the fifth spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Reworked OpenAL source routing around an explicit two-identity source path state: listener room identity remains the global EFX slot, while each source resolves its own source room and path class.
    - Added same-space, adjacent-space, cross-space, portal, exterior-to-interior, interior-to-exterior, and unreachable source path classes.
    - Applied path classes consistently to direct attenuation/HF limits when occlusion is enabled and to per-source reverb send gain/HF colour for normal and merged looping sources.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-two-identity-source-paths-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T11` Done:
  - Implemented the sixth spatial-audio roadmap wave from `docs-dev/proposals/spatial-audio.md`:
    - Preserved authored `client_env_sound` / `env_sound` overrides and continued loading EAX JSON effect profiles, with named authored-zone profile keys added alongside numeric `reverb_effect_id`.
    - Added optional `.aud` sidecars from `maps/<mapname>.aud` or `sound/acoustics/<mapname>.aud` for authored region, portal/opening, and EAX zone refinements.
    - Routed valid sidecar portal hints through the existing one- and two-hop BSP source path resolver so authored data refines route aperture, transmission, and HF colour without replacing automatic spatial audio.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/spatial-audio-authored-sidecar-overrides-2026-04-27.md`.
- `FR-06-T03` Completed:
  - Hardened the SDL3_ttf/HarfBuzz text path in `src/client/font.cpp` so failed `TTF_CreateText(...)` or `TTF_GetStringSize(...)` calls no longer silently drop render/measure segments.
  - Updated TTF glyph cache generation to keep HarfBuzz-shaped glyphs renderable when metrics lookup fails but glyph image extraction succeeds (`TTF_GetGlyphImageForIndex(...)`).
  - Added SDL3_ttf surface text-engine startup validation so TTF mode only stays active when both library init and text engine creation succeed.
  - Finalized accessibility defaults and fallback controls:
    - Consolidated high-visibility text under archived `ui_high_visibility_text 1` so black text backgrounds and related accessibility text behavior have one authoritative cvar.
    - Added archived `ui_text_typeface 2` as the default TrueType selector, with legacy and KEX/kfont options available from settings.
    - Added archived fallback font cvars (`cl_font_fallback_kfont`, `cl_font_fallback_legacy`) so fallback chains remain configurable without code edits.
  - Repaired the console/UI/screen font chain so fixed-width TTF fonts render through a direct per-codepoint TTF path again, and readable client fallbacks now use `fonts/qconfont.kfont` instead of `fonts/qfont.kfont`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/ttf-sdl3-harfbuzz-render-path-hardening-2026-03-27.md`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/fr-06-t03-accessibility-defaults-and-fallback-controls-2026-03-27.md`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/console-font-ttf-kfont-fallback-repair-2026-03-28.md`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/font-ttf-kexfont-alignment-2026-04-27.md`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/font-ttf-test-screen-visual-alignment-2026-04-27.md`.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/font-horizontal-alignment-and-menu-footer-2026-04-27.md`.
  - Extended the TTF-first policy to the actual cgame in-game weapon bar and the bootstrapper splash/legal footer text; client font loading now falls back to platform TTFs when staged project font files are unavailable, with TTF menu measurement kept on the renderer glyph-advance path for stable center/right alignment.
  - Expanded high-visibility black text backgrounds from centerprint-specific contrast bars to shared HUD/menu font wrappers under the single `ui_high_visibility_text` cvar. Added Options -> Accessibility controls and `ui_text_typeface` (`legacy`, `KEX`, `TrueType`, default TrueType), with high-visibility text forcing the effective typeface to TrueType.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/ui-bootstrap-font-handoff-2026-04-27.md`.
  - Stabilized fullscreen/resizable TTF handling so framebuffer size changes refresh font raster pixel height without changing the assigned font kind, expanded shared font-generation invalidation to console and cached weapon-bar paths, and fixed multiline screen/cgame TTF row stepping to use real font line heights.
  - Fixed a HUD font-role mix-up in the cgame SCR bridge so HUD helpers no longer swap between different TTF families (`scr.font` vs. the readable screen/UI font path) as layout or mode paths change.
  - Fixed cgame menu font bootstrap so JSON-selected menu fonts bind immediately through canonical `cl_font` resolution instead of lingering on the startup default until a fullscreen/windowed renderer restart.
  - Implementation log: `docs-dev/ttf-fullscreen-font-pixel-scale-refresh-2026-04-28.md`.

## Baseline Snapshot (Repository-Derived)
- Codebase scale is substantial: approximately 733 `*.c`/`*.cpp`/`*.h`/`*.hpp` files and approximately 426k lines across `src/` and `inc/`.
- Workload concentration is heavily in gameplay and rendering:
  - `src/game/sgame`: 259 files, approximately 128k lines
  - `src/rend_gl`: 39 files, approximately 49k lines
  - `src/client`: 48 files, approximately 41k lines
  - `src/rend_rtx`: 65 files, approximately 38k lines
  - `src/rend_vk`: 15 files, approximately 26k lines
- cgame UI is already a large system:
  - `src/game/cgame/ui/worr.json`: 1869 lines
  - `src/game/cgame/ui/ui_widgets.cpp`: 114k+ bytes
- Build and release automation is mature:
  - Local staging standard: `.install/` via `tools/refresh_install.py`
  - Automated release paths: `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Platform packaging and metadata tooling under `tools/release/`
- Protocol compatibility has dedicated boundaries and tests:
  - `q2proto/` integrated as read-only in policy
  - `q2proto/tests/` contains protocol flavor build tests
- Existing technical debt is visible:
  - 200+ `TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX` markers in first-party `src/` and `inc/` (excluding legacy and third-party trees)
  - Bots are structurally present but not functionally complete (`src/game/sgame/bots/bot_think.cpp` frame hooks are empty)
  - Local TODOs still include major items (`TODO.md`)
- Documentation volume is high and active:
  - `docs-dev/` carries extensive subsystem writeups (renderer, cgame, font, build, release)
  - Some docs show drift against current code paths, signaling curation needs

## SWOT

## Strengths
- Broad gameplay foundation already exists in `sgame`, with many game modes and systems wired (`src/game/sgame/g_local.hpp`, `src/game/sgame/gameplay/*`, `src/game/sgame/match/*`).
- Strong multi-renderer strategy is already implemented: OpenGL (`src/rend_gl`), native Vulkan raster (`src/rend_vk`), and RTX/vkpt (`src/rend_rtx`).
- Release and staging discipline is materially stronger than typical forks (`tools/refresh_install.py`, `tools/release/*`, nightly workflow automation).
- cgame and JSON UI architecture is robust and extensible (`src/game/cgame/*`, `src/game/cgame/ui/*`).
- Documentation culture is real and ongoing (`docs-dev/` has high-frequency change logs and design analyses).
- Clear policy boundaries already exist for critical risks:
  - no Vulkan-to-OpenGL fallback policy
  - q2proto compatibility guardrails

## Weaknesses
- Scope breadth is high enough to fragment focus without enforced project governance.
- Automated quality gates are underdeveloped for core engine/gameplay paths (CI is release-centric, not full PR validation-centric).
- Vulkan parity is still incomplete in multiple high-visibility areas (particle styles, beam styles, flare behavior, post-process parity).
- Bot behavior is not yet production-capable despite plumbing being present.
- Technical debt markers are spread across gameplay, client, renderer, and server paths.
- Cvar namespace modernization is only partially applied (`g_` still dominates many new sgame controls despite `sg_` preference).
- Dependency lifecycle complexity is high (multiple vendored versions of several libraries under `subprojects/`).
- Documentation freshness is uneven (some architecture docs lag current filenames/wiring).

## Opportunities
- Differentiate WORR through native Vulkan parity plus predictable performance improvements.
- Leverage already-rich game mode set into a clear competitive and cooperative offering roadmap.
- Exploit nightly + updater tooling to move toward rapid, measurable, low-friction iteration.
- Convert documentation volume into execution strength by binding work to project IDs and status workflows.
- Add targeted automated tests and smoke harnesses to reduce regression risk as refactors continue.
- Complete C++ migration with module boundaries that reduce long-term maintenance cost.
- Consolidate dependency versions and improve reproducibility/security posture.
- Use analytics/observability for performance baselines and release quality gates.

## Threats
- Regression risk is high due to surface area and currently limited automated gameplay/renderer test coverage.
- Cross-platform support can drift if changes are validated mainly on one host/toolchain.
- Feature creep can outrun finishing work unless work-in-progress limits are enforced.
- Upstream divergence from Q2REPRO, KEX, and reference idTech3 patterns can increase integration cost over time.
- Team coordination cost will rise with parallel renderer/gameplay/UI tracks unless roadmap ownership is explicit.
- Dependency sprawl increases update effort and potential security exposure windows.
- Documentation debt can lead to incorrect decisions when implementation and docs disagree.
- Public expectations around compatibility and re-release parity can be missed without milestone-level acceptance criteria.

- [x] `DV-08-T11` Stabilize the Windows public-bootstrap-to-temp-worker approved-update handoff and add deterministic local automation for that path.  
  Dependency: `DV-08-T09`. Priority: P0.
- [ ] `DV-08-T12` Convert the client bootstrap into a long-lived session shell that owns the display/window lifecycle, keeps updater UX in-process, and reserves the external worker for locked-file replacement and relaunch only.  
  Dependency: `DV-08-T09`, `DV-08-T11`. Priority: P1.
  Progress: Windows session-shell work introduced native splash-shell startup, adopted-window activation, synchronized `.install` staging, and engine-side menu backdrops. This follow-up temporarily disables Windows shared-HWND handoff because Win11 capture/preview APIs were still sampling the bootstrap-owned surface; the splash is kept out of taskbar previews, fullscreen defaults to capture-friendly borderless behavior for PrintScreen/Snipping Tool, and the renderer-owned engine window becomes the app frame. Non-transparent menus now clear the engine backbuffer every frame, the main menu backdrop is fully opaque, and hosted launches request only a short engine-owned fade from black, so stale splash pixels cannot remain blended into the main menu.
  Implementation logs: `docs-dev/bootstrap-session-shell-handoff-2026-04-01.md`, `docs-dev/ui-bootstrap-font-handoff-2026-04-27.md`.
