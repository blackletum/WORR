# Cgame Viewweapon Bob Options (2026-05-06)

## Related Tasks
- `DV-04-T02` - Complete client/cgame ownership map for duplicated behavior paths.
- `FR-03-T06` - Audit and complete settings page cvar wiring for Video/Audio/Input/HUD/Downloads.
- `DV-07-T04` - Add user-doc parity pass whenever user-visible cvars/features are changed.

## Summary
- Added `src/game/cgame/cg_view.cpp` as the cgame-local home for first-person viewweapon pose calculation.
- Added archived cvar `cg_weaponBob` with default `2`:
  - `0` = disabled viewweapon bob
  - `1` = Quake 3-style stride, landing, and idle weapon motion
  - `2` = Doom 3-style stride plus acceleration lag, turn lag, landing, and idle weapon motion
- Routed both the rendered first-person weapon and local player beam starts through the shared helper so heatbeam/grapple origins follow the selected pose consistently.
- Exposed the setting in the cgame Effects menu and documented it in the client user cvar reference.

The requested cvar name intentionally keeps the `cg_weaponBob` spelling even though new cvars usually prefer lowercase `snake_case`; this preserves the user-facing contract requested for the feature.

## Implementation Details

### Cvar and ownership
- `src/game/cgame/cg_entity_api.cpp` registers `cg_weaponBob` as `CVAR_ARCHIVE` with default `2`.
- `src/game/cgame/cg_entity_local.h` exposes the cvar and the new `CG_View_CalcWeaponPose(...)` helper.
- Reserved cgame entity IDs were moved into the shared local header so cgame view/entity helpers use the same constants.
- `meson.build` now includes `src/game/cgame/cg_view.cpp` in `cgame_src`.

### Pose helper
- `CG_View_CalcWeaponPose(...)` always starts from `cl.refdef.vieworg` and `cl.refdef.viewangles`.
- `cg_weaponBob 0` and `bobskip 1` return the base view pose and reset bob state so re-enabling a bob mode starts cleanly.
- `cg_weaponBob 1` applies the Quake 3 weapon-angle bob constants:
  - roll: `xyspeed * bobfracsin * 0.005`
  - yaw: `xyspeed * bobfracsin * 0.01`
  - pitch: `xyspeed * bobfracsin * 0.005`
  - landing deflect/return timing and speed-sensitive idle drift
- `cg_weaponBob 2` keeps the shared stride/landing/idle pieces and adds Doom 3-inspired:
  - local acceleration history translated into weapon positional lag
  - view-angle history translated into weapon turn lag
  - the same default offset tuning used by Doom 3 weapon definitions (`10` averaged frames, `0.25` angle scale, `10` degree clamp, `400 ms` acceleration window, `0.005` acceleration scale)
- The helper caches the pose per `cls.realtime` and mode so multiple same-frame callers do not advance bob history more than once.

### Call sites
- `src/game/cgame/cg_entities.cpp`
  - `CL_AddViewWeapon()` now calls `CG_View_CalcWeaponPose(...)` instead of directly interpolating server `ps->gunoffset` and `ps->gunangles`.
  - Existing client-side `cl_gun_x`, `cl_gun_y`, and `cl_gun_z` development offsets still apply after the shared pose is calculated.
- `src/game/cgame/cg_tent.cpp`
  - `CL_AddPlayerBeams()` now uses the same helper for local beam start points.
  - This keeps local beam origins aligned with `cg_weaponBob` and also honors `bobskip` for cgame beams.

### UI and docs
- `src/game/cgame/ui/worr.json` adds an Effects menu dropdown:
  - `off` -> `0`
  - `Quake 3` -> `1`
  - `Doom 3` -> `2`
- `docs-user/client.asciidoc` documents `cg_weaponBob` and its three values.
- `docs-dev/proposals/swot-feature-development-roadmap-2026-02-27.md` now tracks this work against `DV-04-T02`, `FR-03-T06`, and `DV-07-T04`.

## Validation
- Parsed the updated menu JSON:

```powershell
Get-Content -Raw -Path src\game\cgame\ui\worr.json | ConvertFrom-Json | Out-Null
```

- Built the cgame target successfully in the canonical Windows build directory:

```powershell
meson compile -C builddir-win cgame_x86_64
```

- Attempted the matching `builddir-win` engine rebuild so the embedded menu asset would relink, but that build directory is currently blocked by an existing thin-archive toolchain issue:

```powershell
meson compile -C builddir-win worr_engine_x86_64
```

Blocked archives:
- `subprojects/SDL3_ttf-3.2.2/libsdl3_ttf.a`
- `subprojects/curl-8.18.0/libcurl.a`
- `libq2proto.a`

All failed with `llvm-ar.exe: error: cannot convert a regular archive to a thin one`.

- Rebuilt both the cgame and engine targets successfully through the working Windows bootstrap-hosted build:

```powershell
meson compile -C builddir-win-bootstrap-hosted cgame_x86_64 worr_engine_x86_64
```

- Refreshed and validated local staging from the successful build:

```powershell
python tools\refresh_install.py --build-dir builddir-win-bootstrap-hosted --install-dir .install --base-game basew --platform-id windows-x86_64
```

- Ran a staged OpenGL startup smoke with the new cvar set explicitly:

```powershell
.install\worr_x86_64.exe --bootstrap-skip-update-check +set basedir E:\Repositories\WORR\.install +set r_renderer opengl +set vid_fullscreen 0 +set logfile 1 +set logfile_flush 1 +set logfile_name cg_weaponbob_startup_smoke +set cg_weaponBob 2 +wait 60 +quit
```

Result: exited `0`, loaded the staged `.\basew\cgame_x86_64.dll`, initialized the OpenGL renderer and OpenAL, then shut down cleanly.
