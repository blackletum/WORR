# Quake III Arena BotLib and Q2 AAS Port Plan

Date: 2026-06-16

Status: Implementation In Progress

Roadmap tasks: `FR-04-T01` through `FR-04-T07`, `FR-04-T10` through `FR-04-T16`, and `DV-07-T06`.

## Purpose

Elegantly port the Quake III Arena bot system into WORR by bringing across the useful architecture, data formats, tooling, and behavior patterns while respecting WORR's Quake II Rerelease gameplay, server-game ownership, build layout, and documentation rules.

The port is not a blind file drop. The target is a maintained WORR bot stack with:

- A Quake II map aware AAS generator based on `TTimo/bspc`.
- A rehosted Q3A BotLib/AAS runtime behind a narrow WORR adapter.
- WORR-native fake-client, command, cvar, match, and debug integration.
- Q2/Q2R weapon, item, movement, team, and coop behavior layered above the imported navigation primitives.
- Full source credit, license, and provenance tracking for every upstream-derived file and concept.

## Source Baseline

Primary local source:

- Quake III Arena source tree: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake-III-Arena-master`
- Q3A BotLib runtime: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake-III-Arena-master\code\botlib`
- Q3A game bot behavior: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake-III-Arena-master\code\game\g_bot.c`, `ai_main.c`, `ai_dmq3.c`, `ai_dmnet.c`, `ai_team.c`, `ai_chat.c`, `ai_cmd.c`, and related `be_ai_*.h` APIs.
- Q3A fake-client and BotLib import glue: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake-III-Arena-master\code\server\sv_bot.c`
- Q3A BSPC/AAS generator lineage: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake-III-Arena-master\code\bspc`

Required external tool baseline:

- `TTimo/bspc`: `https://github.com/TTimo/bspc`
- The repository describes itself as the Quake III Arena BSP-to-AAS compiler, is forked from `bnoordhuis/bspc`, includes Quake II BSP/map support files such as `l_bsp_q2.c`, `map_q2.c`, and `q2files.h`, and is licensed as GPL-2.0-or-later per its README/license.

Current WORR bot surface:

- The inherited Quake II Rerelease `bot_debug.*`, `bot_exports.*`, and `bot_utils.*` surface has been removed from `src/game/sgame/bots/` because it targets a different engine-side bot system.
- `src/game/sgame/bots/bot_runtime.*` owns the WORR BotLib/AAS lifecycle, public `sg_bot_*` cvars, active-map AAS setup, and frame-level entity sync.
- `src/game/sgame/bots/botlib_adapter.*` owns the narrow bridge to imported Q3A BotLib/AAS code.
- `src/game/sgame/bots/bot_nav.*` owns AAS route lookup, cached route state, persistent route goals, command steering data, and native route/goal debug overlays.
- `src/game/sgame/bots/bot_think.*` keeps `Bot_BeginFrame` and `Bot_EndFrame` as AAS-gated lifecycle hooks and exposes the AAS route-steered `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` path for server-owned bot `usercmd_t` dispatch.
- The old Q2R game-export bot callbacks are explicitly unavailable from `sgame`; future weapon, item, trigger, and use behavior must land in a new WORR bot action layer above the BotLib/AAS path. `Entity_ForceLookAtPoint` remains as a standalone helper exported outside the removed bot surface.
- `src/game/sgame/client/client_session_service_impl.cpp` already marks bot clients with `SVF_BOT` and calls `Bot_BeginFrame`.
- `src/game/sgame/player/p_view.cpp` already calls `Bot_EndFrame`.

## Guiding Decisions

1. Port the architecture before the behavior. First make AAS generation, BotLib loading, entity updates, and bot input plumbing reliable; only then expand combat/team intelligence.

2. Keep Q3A code in a quarantine boundary. Upstream-derived C code should live in clearly named BotLib/tooling directories with minimal local edits, explicit wrappers, and retained license headers. WORR behavior should call into it through adapter APIs instead of spreading Q3 globals through `sgame`.

3. Build Q2-native behavior above Q3 primitives. Q3A's Area Awareness System, goal weights, movement results, character files, and team AI are valuable. Q3A's item IDs, weapons, powerups, game modes, VM trap model, and player movement assumptions need translation.

4. Make AAS a first-class build artifact. Bots must not depend on hand-authored waypoints. AAS generation should be reproducible, validated, and staged with `.install/basew` whenever maps/assets are packaged.

5. Use `sg_` for new server-game cvars. Existing imported `bot_*` debug names may be retained inside quarantined upstream compatibility layers, but new public WORR controls should use `sg_bot_*`.

6. Preserve credits continuously. Every phase has an explicit credit/provenance checklist. A task is not done until source attribution is updated.

## Q3A to WORR Difference Matrix

This project must treat game and architecture differences as first-order design input, not cleanup after the port.

| Area | Quake III Arena Assumption | WORR / Quake II Rerelease Reality | Porting Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game module architecture | Q3 game code calls engine traps from a VM-style boundary. | WORR `sgame` is native C++ and already has KEX/Q2R-style game imports. | Replace trap calls with a narrow BotLib adapter and keep imported globals quarantined. |
| Fake clients | Q3 server owns `SV_BotAllocateClient`, `NA_BOT`, and BotLib import setup. | WORR already has client session services, `SVF_BOT`, and match logic that distinguishes bots from humans. | Integrate through WORR session services, not by copying Q3 server slot code directly. |
| Movement physics | Q3 pmove, acceleration, jump, crouch, and weapon movement expectations. | Q2 movement, step heights, water movement, crouch behavior, ladders where supported, knockback, and Q2 weapon timing. | Translate route results into Q2 `usercmd_t` steering and tune AAS reachability to Q2 movement constants. |
| Map format | Q3 BSP plus Q3-oriented AAS generation. | Q2 IBSP38 maps, Q2R-era extensions/tolerance needs, `.pak`/`.pkz` staging under `basew`. | Tailor `TTimo/bspc` Q2 loaders and configs; validate BSPX/extra lump tolerance before runtime reliance. |
| Navigation data | Q3 maps generally expect prebuilt `.aas` for BotLib. | WORR must support Q2 maps without manual waypoint files. | Make `worr_q2aas` reproducible and package/generate AAS as part of the build/release workflow. |
| Entity model | Q3 `gentity_t`, `entityState_t`, item/powerup IDs, and event model. | WORR has Q2/KEX `gentity_t`, `gclient_t`, `sv` bot-facing state, monsters, traps, movers, and Q2 item IDs. | Build explicit entity-state translation and avoid direct struct reuse. |
| Weapons | Q3 weapons and ammo economy. | Q2 weapons, ammo, inventory items, expansion weapons, splash rules, BFG behavior, weapon switching helpers. | Create WORR weapon metadata and use existing bot export helpers instead of Q3 weapon IDs. |
| Items and goals | Q3 item config, weights, and arena item distribution. | Q2 pickups, armor tiers, powerups, keys/objectives in coop, flags/techs in team modes. | Keep the goal/weight concept but author Q2-specific item configs and filters. |
| Match modes | Q3 FFA, tournament, team, CTF assumptions. | WORR includes Q2/Q2R match states, map voting, mymap queue, warmup/intermission logic, and possible coop scope. | Integrate with existing match services and make bots opt into each mode deliberately. |
| Coop/NPC context | Q3 bot AI is multiplayer-arena focused. | WORR also has monsters/NPCs, campaign maps, triggers, doors, and coop progression needs. | Keep coop as a later phase with explicit follow/wait/lead/resource-sharing behavior. |
| Filesystem/assets | Q3 `baseq3`, `pk3`, botfiles, arenas, scripts. | WORR `basew`, `.install`, `pak0.pkz`, current asset packaging rules. | Adapt paths and staging; do not assume Q3 directory names survive publicly. |
| Build system | Q3 make/project files and old C assumptions. | WORR Meson, mixed C/C++20, warning cleanup, local `.install` staging. | Build imported C behind Meson object/static-library boundaries and document warning exceptions. |
| Debug rendering | Q3 debug lines/polygons through server/BotLib hooks. | WORR already has debug draw imports (`Draw_Line`, `Draw_Point`, `Draw_Bounds`, etc.). | Map Q3 debug primitives to WORR draw APIs and preserve developer cvar gates. |
| Protocol/networking | Q3 bot commands and client state are Q3-specific. | WORR must preserve legacy Q2 server/demo compatibility and avoid q2proto churn. | Keep bot control server-side; do not change protocol unless a separate task explicitly proves the need. |
| Licensing/provenance | Q3A and BSPC are GPL-family upstreams with historical file headers. | WORR also carries GPL-compatible lineage and local ZeniMax/WORR headers. | Maintain file-level source ledger, retain headers, and credit direct imports separately from inspirations. |

- The runtime can load a generated `.aas`, answer simple area/reachability/route/movement-helper queries, and advance the imported AAS start-frame path.
- Debug polygons/lines and imported Q3A AAS area helper output can render through WORR debug draw.

## Phase 3: Fake Clients, Commands, and Profiles

Primary task: `FR-04-T13`

Goal: make bots join/leave like intentional WORR participants.

Implementation checklist:

- [x] Remove inherited Q2R bot debug/export/entity-state registrar files from `src/game/sgame/bots/` so new work targets the WORR/Q3A BotLib replacement path.
- [x] Audit current bot slot creation in `client_session_service_impl.cpp`.
- [ ] Add commands:
  - [x] `sg_bot_add [profile] [team]`
  - [x] `sg_bot_remove <name|slot|all>`
  - [x] `sg_bot_kick_all`
  - [x] `sg_bot_list`
  - [x] `sg_bot_min_players`
  - [x] `sg_bot_reload_profiles`
- [ ] Add safeguards:
  - [x] Respect maxclients.
  - [x] Defer same-frame multi-bot add requests so more than one local bot can spawn safely.
  - [x] Clamp automatic min-player fill to public client slots.
  - [x] Respect match mode team limits.
  - [x] Do not count bots as humans for server population policies that already distinguish them.
  - [x] Remove only auto-managed bots when lowering `sg_bot_min_players` or disabling `sg_bot_enable`.
  - [x] Free bot clients cleanly on disconnect, map end, and mode changes.
    - [x] Explicit remove, kick-all, and server shutdown use bot-aware teardown without q2proto or anti-cheat disconnect traffic.
    - [x] Mode-change and team-limit cleanup moves surplus bots to spectators when active match limits tighten.
- [ ] Add profile loading:
  - [x] Start with Q3A-style character files as an import format.
  - [x] Add a WORR-local key/value `.bot` profile format using the same parser.
  - [x] Map initial profile fields to display name, skin, team, and skill.
  - [x] Map richer profile fields to reaction, aggression, aim error, preferred weapons, chat personality, team role, and movement style.
- [ ] Add initial profile assets under `assets/` only after credit/source ownership is clear.

2026-06-17 implementation slice:

- Engine-owned fake bot clients now allocate real public client slots, call game `ClientConnect(..., true)` / `ClientBegin`, and mark `client_t::bot` so game session state receives the existing bot path.
- Bot slots are removed through `SV_BotRemove()` / `SV_BotRemoveAll()` and are skipped by q2proto disconnect writes, anti-cheat disconnect handling, client print/send loops, final server messages, status responses, and human population counts.
- `sg_bot_add`, `sg_bot_remove`, `sg_bot_kick_all`, and `sg_bot_list` provide the first operator command surface.
- `SV_BotAdd()` now queues same-frame add requests after the first active bot and processes one queued bot per following server frame.
- Bot entity spawn preserves `SVF_BOT`, and `InitPlayerTeam()` assigns bots before host/owner auto-join logic so slot 0 bots do not land as spectators.
- `sv_bot_slot_smoke` provides an unattended dedicated-server add/remove lifecycle smoke; mode `2` now validates Alpha add/remove, Bravo active add, Charlie deferred add, two active bots, and full cleanup before exit.
- `sg_bot_min_players` now maintains auto-managed fake clients while `sg_bot_enable` is active, treats manual bots as satisfying the target, clamps the target to public slots, and removes only `bot_autofill` clients when the target drops or bot support is disabled.
- `sv_bot_min_players_smoke` provides an unattended dedicated-server fill/trim/disable smoke; mode `2` validates `B|bot1`, `B|bot2`, and `B|bot3` auto-fill to count `3`, target trim to one auto bot, disable cleanup back to `0`, and the prior multi-slot smoke remains clean afterward.
- `sg_bot_reload_profiles` now reloads a bounded server profile table from `botfiles/bots/*.c`, `bots/profiles/*.bot`, and `bots/*.bot`; `sg_bot_add [profile] [team]` resolves profiles before falling back to display-name behavior, and `sg_bot_profile` can feed min-player autofill when it names a loaded profile.
- `sv_bot_profile_smoke` provides an unattended dedicated-server profile smoke; mode `2` validates a temporary `smoke` profile, `B|Smoke` spawn, `bot_profile=smoke`, `skin=male/grunt`, `skill=4`, and full cleanup before exit.
- Bot profiles now preserve reaction, aggression, aim error, preferred weapon, chat personality, team role, and movement-style fields, accepting common Q3A/WORR aliases and exposing the values as `bot_*` userinfo keys for later game-side policy.
- `sv_bot_profile_smoke` now validates the richer profile bridge with `reaction=250`, `aggression=0.65`, `aim_error=2.5`, `preferred_weapon=rocketlauncher`, `chat=quiet`, `role=attacker`, and `movement=strafe` on the temporary `smoke` profile.
- Bot initial team assignment now respects match lock, `GameFlags::OneVOne` two-player active caps, and positive `maxplayers` limits; surplus bots start as spectators instead of bypassing `SetTeam()` by direct session assignment.
- `Bot_EnforceMatchTeamPolicy(true)` runs after cvar checks each game frame, preserving active humans first and moving surplus active bots to spectators when `maxplayers` or mode rules tighten.
- `sv_bot_team_policy_smoke` now validates the policy directly from the game module: a three-bot Duel setup reports `playing=2`, `spectators=1`, `bots=3`, then cleanup reports zero bots with both status lines passing.
- The fake-client frame-command path now requests an AAS route-steered command from `sgame`, faces the first predicted route step, and reports route counters through `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke`.
- Remaining limitations: curated profile assets, general behavior-authored navigation goal policy, natural map-backed crouch/swim/waterjump movement-state validation, door/trigger retry, and higher-level behavior policy remain pending.

Exit criteria:

- A server operator can add and remove a named bot without restarting the map.
- Bot profiles load deterministically.
- Bot names, skins, teams, score, deaths, and spectator state remain sane in match UI.

## Phase 4: Entity Sync, Perception, and Scheduling

Primary tasks: `FR-04-T02`, `FR-04-T14`

Goal: feed bots a coherent world model on a fixed budget.

Implementation checklist:

- [ ] Expand `Entity_UpdateState` coverage where needed:
  - [ ] Players.
  - [ ] Bots.
  - [ ] Spectators.
  - [ ] Monsters/NPCs.
  - [ ] Items/powerups/ammo.
  - [ ] Dropped weapons/items.
  - [ ] Traps/projectiles/hazards.
  - [ ] Doors/plats/movers.
  - [ ] Objectives/flags.
- [x] Push entity updates into BotLib each frame or on a staggered schedule.
  - [x] Push a full per-frame WORR snapshot into imported `AAS_UpdateEntity` after the server entity-state update pass.
  - [ ] Add staggered scheduling for expensive perception checks that do not need full-rate updates.
- [ ] Add bot blackboard state:
  - [ ] Current enemy.
  - [ ] Last seen enemy.
  - [ ] Heard/damaged-by events.
  - [ ] Current goal.
  - [ ] Route state.
  - [ ] Stuck timer.
  - [ ] Item reservation.
  - [ ] Team role.
- [ ] Use staggered expensive checks:
  - [ ] Visibility traces split across frames.
  - [ ] Item desirability updates split across bots.
  - [ ] Route recomputation rate limited.
  - [ ] Enemy memory decay instead of all-knowing target locks.
- [ ] Add fairness constraints:
  - [ ] Bots only aim at entities they could plausibly know.
  - [ ] Skill affects reaction and accuracy, not omniscience.
  - [ ] Item timers can be disabled or fuzzed through cvars.

Exit criteria:

- Eight bots can run the perception loop without large server frame spikes.
- Debug overlay can show a selected bot's enemy, route, goal, and known items.

## Phase 5: Navigation and Movement

Primary tasks: `FR-04-T02`, `FR-04-T05`, `FR-04-T14`

Goal: turn AAS route information into Quake II movement commands.

Implementation checklist:

- [ ] Map Q3A `bot_input_t` style output to WORR/Q2 `usercmd_t`.
  - [x] Add first-step AAS route steering directly into `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()`.
  - [x] Move route cache and query cadence into `bot_nav.*`.
  - [x] Keep a persistent native route goal area across cadence and cache reuse.
  - [x] Select a live active-pickup entity as the first native persistent route goal.
  - [x] Move high-level command/goal ownership into `bot_brain.*`.
  - [x] Add a debug/smoke-backed position route goal through `bot_brain.*`, `bot_nav.*`, and the BotLib adapter.
- [ ] Implement movement states:
  - [ ] Ground steering.
    - [x] Initial route-target yaw plus forward movement for a spawned bot.
  - [x] Jump.
  - [x] Crouch.
  - [x] Swim.
  - [ ] Ladder if supported by map metadata.
  - [ ] Door/plat wait/use.
  - [ ] Teleporter traversal.
- [ ] Add steering smoothing:
  - [x] Look-ahead route points.
  - [ ] Corner cutting where safe.
  - [x] Velocity-aware aim direction.
  - [ ] Avoid jittering between adjacent areas.
    - [x] Reuse cached route steps for short windows instead of rebuilding the route every command frame.
- [ ] Add stuck recovery:
  - [x] Repath.
  - [x] Short dodge/back-off.
  - [x] Goal blacklist cooldown.
  - [ ] Door/trigger retry.
  - [ ] Last-resort respawn/spectator handling only in debug or controlled modes.
- [ ] Add movement debug:
  - [x] Current AAS area.
  - [x] Route polyline.
    - [x] Draw cached bot route step and goal markers while route/goal debug is enabled.
    - [x] Draw bounded sampled route points from the cached Q3A route-steer result.
  - [x] Selected debug client filter for cached route/goal overlays.
  - [x] Next reachability type.
  - [x] Stuck reason.
  - [x] Failed goal reason.
  - [x] Route query/cache counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.
  - [x] Persistent route-goal request, assignment, reuse, clear, and fallback counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.
  - [x] Active item-goal scan, candidate, assignment, reuse, clear, and selected-item counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.
  - [x] Stuck recovery activation and command counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.
  - [x] Item-goal blacklist activation, skip, active cooldown, and last blacklisted item counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.
  - [x] Movement-state command counters in the dedicated frame-command smoke.

2026-06-17 route-steered command slice:

- `Q3A_BotLibImport_BuildRouteSteer()` and `BotLibAdapter_BuildRouteSteer()` expose a deterministic, live AAS route-steering query without spreading Q3A globals into `sgame`.
- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` now queries AAS route state each accepted bot frame, turns toward the first predicted route step, and emits forward movement through the normal server fake-client command path.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` now reports `route_queries=8`, `route_commands=8`, `route_failures=0`, `last_start_area=224`, `last_goal_area=227`, `last_route_end_area=217`, `last_travel_time=130`, and `last_reachability=218`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-route-steered-frame-commands-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-17 route-cache slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now owns per-client cached route-steer results and resets them on BotLib level begin/end.
- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` now asks `BotNav_GetRouteSteer()` for route state, so accepted command frames reuse a recent route step unless cadence, target reach, origin drift, or preferred-goal changes require a refresh.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` now reports `route_requests=8`, `route_queries=2`, `route_refreshes=2`, `route_reuses=6`, `route_commands=8`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-route-cache-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-17 nav debug overlay slice:

- `BotNav_DrawDebugOverlay()` now draws cached bot route-step arrows and goal markers for `sg_bot_debug_route` / `sg_bot_debug_goal`.
- `RunBotLibDebugDrawIfRequested()` uses the cached native `bot_nav` overlay once a route exists, with the imported Q3A sample route overlay retained as a fallback before any bot route is cached.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` with route/goal debug enabled reports `route_debug_frames=10`, `route_debug_routes=8`, `route_debug_goals=8`, `route_debug_missing_frames=2`, `route_debug_arrows=8`, `last_route_debug_client=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-debug-overlay-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-17 nav reachability debug slice:

- `Q3A_BotLibImport_BuildRouteSteer()` now resolves the selected reachability and carries travel type, travel flags, and reachability end area through `BotLibAdapterRouteSteer`.
- `bot_nav.*` now records current AAS area and next reachability metadata in `BotNavRouteStatus`, draws a short cached route label while route debug is enabled, and counts emitted labels.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` with route/goal debug enabled reports `route_debug_labels=8`, `last_current_area=224`, `last_reachability_type=2`, `last_reachability_flags=2`, `last_reachability_end_area=217`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-reachability-debug-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-17 nav polyline debug slice:

- `Q3A_BotLibImport_BuildRouteSteer()` now samples up to eight predicted route endpoints after validating the full route, while preserving the existing first-step steering result.
- `BotLibAdapterRouteSteer` and `bot_nav.*` now carry cached route points, draw the first segment as the route arrow, draw intermediate sampled segments as a bounded polyline, and keep the goal marker.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` with route/goal debug enabled reports `route_debug_polyline_points=16`, `route_debug_polyline_segments=24`, `last_route_point_count=2`, `route_debug_lines=16`, `route_debug_arrows=8`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-polyline-debug-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-17 nav debug client-filter slice:

- `sg_bot_debug_client` now filters native cached route/goal overlays by zero-based client slot, with `-1` retaining the default all-bots overlay mode.
- `BotNav_DrawDebugOverlay()` skips non-selected cached route slots, counts filtered slots and filter-miss frames, and keeps the selected filter value in `last_debug_filter_client`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` with `sg_bot_debug_client 0` reports the active bot route overlay with `route_debug_routes=8`, `route_debug_filtered_slots=0`, `last_debug_filter_client=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` with `sg_bot_debug_client 1` filters out slot 0 and reports `route_debug_routes=0`, `route_debug_filtered_slots=8`, `route_debug_filter_miss_frames=10`, `last_debug_filter_client=1`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-debug-client-filter-2026-06-17.md`.

2026-06-18 nav persistent-goal slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now assigns the first successful route goal area as a persistent per-client route goal and requests that area on later route refreshes.
- Persistent goal state falls back to a fresh imported route goal if the preferred area stops routing, and clears when the cached goal origin is reached.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` reports `route_goal_requests=1`, `route_goal_assignments=1`, `route_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `route_goal_clears=0`, `route_goal_fallbacks=0`, `last_persistent_goal_area=227`, `last_goal_clear_reason=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-persistent-goal-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 legacy Q2R bot surface removal slice:

- Removed inherited Q2R bot files `src/game/sgame/bots/bot_debug.*`, `bot_exports.*`, and `bot_utils.*` from source control and the Meson build.
- Removed the old debug cvars, `Bot_UpdateDebug()` frame call, and sgame-side bot entity register/unregister flow that depended on the removed Q2R surface.
- Removed the legacy `info_nav_lock` spawn registration because its implementation lived in the deleted Q2R bot utility layer.
- `G_GetGameAPI()` now leaves the old bot action/export callbacks unavailable while retaining `Entity_ForceLookAtPoint` as a standalone helper.
- The active `src/game/sgame/bots/` implementation surface is now `bot_runtime.*`, `botlib_adapter.*`, `bot_nav.*`, `bot_think.*`, and `q3a/`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` after the removal reports `frames=8`, `commands=8`, `route_failures=0`, `route_goal_assignments=1`, `last_persistent_goal_area=227`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-legacy-bot-surface-removal-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav item-goal slice:

- `Q3A_BotLibImport_FindRouteAreaForPoint()` and `BotLibAdapter_FindRouteAreaForPoint()` expose point-to-route-area lookup through the existing adapter boundary.
- `bot_nav.*` now scans active pickup entities, applies first-pass health/armor/ammo/weapon/powerup/high-value utility, resolves the selected pickup to an AAS area, and asks the route cache to keep that area as the persistent goal.
- Route slots remember selected item entity number, entity spawn count, item id, and AAS area so item goals clear when the pickup respawn-hides, disappears, or changes identity.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 2` reports `item_goal_scans=1`, `item_goal_candidates=45`, `item_goal_assignments=1`, `item_goal_reuses=7`, `last_item_goal_entity=32`, `last_item_goal_area=415`, `last_item_goal_item=53`, `last_persistent_goal_area=415`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-item-goal-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav item-reservation slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now treats another bot's live selected pickup route slot as an active item reservation.
- Item-goal scans skip reserved pickup entities, record the skipped entity and owning client, and continue scoring other active pickups.
- Bot disconnect resets that client's route slot so item reservations do not survive removed bot clients.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` adds two bots and reports `item_goal_reservation_skips=1`, `item_goal_active_reservations=2`, `last_item_goal_reserved_entity=32`, `last_item_goal_reserved_by_client=0`, `last_item_goal_entity=74`, `last_item_goal_area=251`, `route_goal_assignments=2`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-item-reservation-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav look-ahead steering slice:

- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` now steers toward a selected sampled route point rather than always aiming at only the immediate route step.
- The command builder advances through the bounded route polyline while points remain inside a short local look-ahead distance, keeping the existing route-goal fallback for degenerate targets.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `lookahead_attempts=17`, `lookahead_uses=9`, `last_lookahead_point_count=2`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-lookahead-steering-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav velocity-steering slice:

- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` now applies a short velocity-aware yaw adjustment after route-point look-ahead selects the target.
- The command builder predicts the bot's horizontal origin `0.10` seconds ahead when movement exceeds a small threshold, but keeps the existing direction if the lead would overshoot the selected target.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `velocity_lead_attempts=17`, `velocity_lead_uses=3`, `last_velocity_lead_speed_sq=182`, `last_velocity_lead_offset_sq=1`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-velocity-steering-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav stuck-repath slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now tracks progress toward the active route goal across cached route uses and cadence refreshes.
- A sustained no-progress window produces `BotNavRefreshReason::Stuck`, forcing the normal route refresh/repath path and reporting stuck reason fields in the debug overlay and frame-command status.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 4` adds an internal stalled-command mode that builds bot commands without applying them, creating a deterministic no-progress validation case.
- Normal `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `stuck_detections=0`, `stuck_repath_refreshes=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`; stalled `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 4` reports `stuck_detections=2`, `stuck_repath_refreshes=2`, `last_stuck_reason=1`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-stuck-repath-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav stuck-recovery command slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now activates a short recovery window after a stuck detection, tracking recovery activations, active recovery frames, last recovery client, strafe side, and frames remaining.
- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` applies a small back/strafe command during that recovery window, after normal route yaw selection, while leaving ordinary route-following commands unchanged.
- Normal `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `stuck_recovery_activations=0`, `stuck_recovery_frames=0`, `recovery_command_uses=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`; stalled `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 4` reports `stuck_recovery_activations=2`, `stuck_recovery_frames=11`, `recovery_command_uses=11`, `last_recovery_forward_move=-80`, `last_recovery_side_move=-140`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-stuck-recovery-command-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav goal-blacklist cooldown slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now blacklists the current active-pickup goal for the stuck bot when the stuck-progress watchdog fires and the item is still available.
- The blacklist is per bot and per item identity, using entity number, spawn count, and item id; active-pickup scans skip matching blacklisted goals and immediately continue scoring other pickups.
- Clearing a persistent goal due to blacklist uses `last_goal_clear_reason=5` and preserves the active short recovery window so the dodge/back-off command still runs.
- Normal `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `item_goal_blacklist_activations=0`, `item_goal_blacklist_skips=0`, `item_goal_blacklist_active=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`; stalled `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 4` reports `item_goal_blacklist_activations=2`, `item_goal_blacklist_skips=2`, `item_goal_blacklist_active=2`, `last_item_goal_blacklisted_entity=68`, `last_goal_clear_reason=5`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-goal-blacklist-cooldown-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav failed-goal reason slice:

- `bot_nav.*` now records explicit failed-goal reasons before abandoned persistent goal state is cleared.
- Route fallback, item unavailable, and blacklisted item goals count as failed-goal events; reached goals and resets do not count as failures.
- The live route debug label includes the route slot's last failed reason, and `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke` reports the failed event count plus last failed reason, client, area, entity, and item id.
- Normal `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports `failed_goal_events=0`, `last_failed_goal_reason=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`; stalled `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 4` reports `failed_goal_events=2`, `last_goal_clear_reason=5`, `last_failed_goal_reason=3`, `last_failed_goal_client=1`, `last_failed_goal_area=251`, `last_failed_goal_entity=74`, `last_failed_goal_item=2`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-failed-goal-reason-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav movement-state command slice:

- `Bot_BuildFrameCommand()` now maps selected AAS reachability travel types to Q2 `usercmd_t` button intent after route yaw and forward movement are chosen.
- Crouch reachability presses `BUTTON_CROUCH`; barrier jump, jump, and waterjump press `BUTTON_JUMP`; swim and ladder reachability press jump or crouch based on whether the current route target is above or below the bot.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke` modes `5`, `6`, and `7` force jump, crouch, and swim reachability command translation through the normal sgame command builder without widening the extension ABI.
- Normal `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` reports real `mm-rage` walk reachability with `movement_state_attempts=17`, `movement_state_commands=0`, `last_movement_state_travel_type=2`, and `pass=1`; forced jump/crouch/swim smokes report `movement_state_jump_commands=17`, `movement_state_crouch_commands=17`, and `movement_state_swim_commands=17` respectively with `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-movement-state-commands-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 bot brain command ownership slice:

- `bot_brain.*` now owns the current high-level frame command/status implementation, including route steering, recovery command application, movement-state button intent, and frame-command smoke status.
- `bot_think.*` remains as the stable `Bot_*` wrapper surface used by existing game/server extension callers, delegating to `BotBrain_*` without widening the ABI.
- `bot_brain.cpp` is now part of the `sgame` build and `bot_brain.hpp` is included by the bot umbrella header for future brain-owned policy growth.
- Refreshed-install smokes on `mm-rage` keep normal command dispatch clean with `frames=17`, `commands=17`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`; forced jump smoke reports `movement_state_jump_commands=17` and `pass=1`; stalled-command smoke reports `stuck_detections=2`, `failed_goal_events=2`, `recovery_command_uses=11`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-bot-brain-command-ownership-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav position-goal slice:

- `bot_brain.*` now builds an internal debug/smoke route request for a world-space position goal, and `bot_nav.*` prioritizes that request over item-goal scans while preserving normal item-goal behavior when no position goal is active.
- `Q3A_BotLibImport_BuildRouteSteerToGoal()` and `BotLibAdapter_BuildRouteSteerToGoal()` preserve the exact resolved position-goal origin for preferred-goal routing, while existing area-only item and fallback routes keep the old `BuildRouteSteer()` path.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 8` is a one-bot position-goal proof on `mm-rage`, reporting `position_goal_requests=8`, `position_goal_resolved=8`, `position_goal_assignments=1`, `position_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `item_goal_scans=0`, `route_goal_fallbacks=0`, `last_position_goal_area=227`, `last_position_goal_z=98`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Normal, stalled, and forced-jump regression smokes keep `position_goal_requests=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-position-goal-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav natural travel-goal slice:

- `Q3A_BotLibImport_BuildRouteSteerForTravelType()` and `BotLibAdapter_BuildRouteSteerForTravelType()` now support route requests whose selected next reachability must match a requested AAS travel type.
- `Q3A_BotLibImport_FindRouteStartForTravelType()` provides a validated smoke start finder so the natural movement-state proof can begin on a real requested-travel-type-capable `mm-rage` AAS area instead of forcing a travel type at the default spawn.
- `bot_nav.*` tracks travel-type goal requests, resolutions, assignments, cache reuses, clears, and last selected travel-type goal metadata separately from item and position goals.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 9` requests natural `TRAVEL_JUMP`, enables a smoke-only start warp, and reports `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=107`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=111`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=2`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=1`, `travel_type_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `last_reachability_type=5`, `movement_state_jump_commands=8`, `last_movement_state_forced_travel_type=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 10` requests natural `TRAVEL_LADDER`, enables the same smoke-only start warp, and reports `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=142`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=143`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=2`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=1`, `travel_type_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `last_reachability_type=6`, `movement_state_ladder_commands=8`, `last_movement_state_forced_travel_type=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 11` requests natural `TRAVEL_WALKOFFLEDGE`, treats it as a route-only travel-type goal, and reports `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=29`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=34`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=2`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=1`, `travel_type_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `last_reachability_type=7`, `route_commands=8`, `movement_state_commands=0`, `last_movement_state_forced_travel_type=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 12` requests natural `TRAVEL_ELEVATOR`, treats it as a route-only travel-type goal, and reports `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=241`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=261`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=2`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=1`, `travel_type_goal_cache_reuses=6`, `last_reachability_type=11`, `route_commands=8`, `movement_state_commands=0`, `movement_state_unsupported=0`, `last_movement_state_forced_travel_type=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 13` requests natural `TRAVEL_BARRIERJUMP`, uses the direct outgoing-reachability fallback for the packaged `mm-rage.aas` barrier candidate, and reports `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=292`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=318`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=8`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=8`, `last_reachability=319`, `last_reachability_type=4`, `movement_state_jump_commands=8`, `last_movement_state_forced_travel_type=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Normal, stalled, forced-jump, and position-goal regression smokes keep `travel_type_goal_requests=0`, `travel_type_goal_start_warps=0`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Natural map-backed crouch, swim, and waterjump validation remains pending.
- Full door/elevator cooperation remains pending above the route-only `TRAVEL_ELEVATOR` AAS reachability proof.
- Implementation logs: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-travel-goal-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-ladder-travel-goal-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-walkoffledge-travel-goal-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-elevator-travel-goal-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-barrierjump-travel-goal-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav rocket-jump route policy slice:

- Q3A route queries now use a runtime policy from `sg_bot_allow_rocketjump`, keeping `TFL_ROCKETJUMP` out of normal route flags unless the cvar is explicitly enabled.
- Direct travel-type helper and fallback paths obey the same policy, so internal route-goal smokes cannot bypass the default-off rocket-jump gate.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 14` enables `sg_bot_allow_rocketjump 1`, requests natural `TRAVEL_ROCKETJUMP`, and reports `travel_type_goal_resolved=2`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=1`, `travel_type_goal_start_warps=1`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_area=282`, `last_travel_type_goal_start_goal_area=304`, `last_reachability=312`, `last_reachability_type=12`, `route_failures=0`, and `pass=1`.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 15` leaves rocket-jump routing disabled, expects the travel-type goal to be blocked, and reports `commands=0`, `route_commands=0`, `travel_type_goal_requests=8`, `travel_type_goal_resolved=0`, `travel_type_goal_assignments=0`, `travel_type_goal_start_warps=0`, `route_failures=8`, `travel_type_goal_expect_blocked=1`, and `pass=1`.
- Normal, elevator, and barrier-jump regression smokes keep `route_failures=0` and `pass=1` after the route policy gate.
- Actual rocket-jump weapon/action execution remains pending above route selection.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-rocketjump-policy-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav four-bot frame-command smoke slice:

- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 16` now targets up to four public bot slots and grows the smoke bot count one server frame at a time.
- The smoke harness reports `q3a_bot_frame_command_smoke_multi_bot_target=4`, adds `B|Mover`, `B|MoverTwo`, `B|MoverThree`, and `B|MoverFour`, and reuses the existing frame-command status pass criteria with `expected_min_frames=4` and `expected_min_commands=4`.
- The refreshed-install four-bot smoke on `mm-rage` reports `frames=38`, `commands=38`, `route_requests=38`, `route_queries=11`, `route_refreshes=11`, `route_reuses=27`, `route_commands=38`, `route_failures=0`, `route_goal_assignments=4`, `item_goal_assignments=4`, `item_goal_reservation_skips=6`, `item_goal_active_reservations=4`, `route_debug_routes=38`, `route_debug_goals=38`, and `pass=1`.
- Normal two-bot `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 3` regression still reports `route_failures=0`, `item_goal_active_reservations=2`, and `pass=1` after the shared add loop change.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-four-bot-frame-command-smoke-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav eight-bot frame-command smoke slice:

- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 17` now targets up to eight public bot slots while preserving the existing four-bot mode `16`.
- The smoke bot-name helper now covers `B|Mover` through `B|MoverEight`, letting the existing one-bot-per-frame add loop grow to eight active fake clients.
- The refreshed-install eight-bot smoke on `mm-rage` reports `frames=92`, `commands=92`, `route_requests=92`, `route_queries=29`, `route_refreshes=29`, `route_reuses=63`, `route_commands=92`, `route_failures=0`, `route_goal_assignments=11`, `item_goal_assignments=11`, `item_goal_reservation_skips=49`, `item_goal_active_reservations=8`, `route_debug_routes=92`, `route_debug_goals=92`, and `pass=1`.
- Four-bot `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 16` regression still reports `frames=38`, `commands=38`, `route_commands=38`, `route_failures=0`, `item_goal_active_reservations=4`, and `pass=1` after the mode `17` extension.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-eight-bot-frame-command-smoke-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav soak frame-command smoke slice:

- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 18` now runs an eight-bot long-duration route-command soak, defaulting to `600000` ms through `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke_soak_ms`.
- The soak prints begin/progress/complete lines, keeps the normal final `q3a_bot_frame_command_status`, and sets internal `sg_bot_frame_command_smoke_soak=1` so the long-run pass gate focuses on command throughput and zero route failures while mode `17` remains the active-reservation pressure proof.
- `bot_nav` now records `item_goal_peak_active_reservations`, and `SV_BotClientThink()` tops up local bot command budget before applying server-authored bot commands to avoid long-run `commandMsec underflow` noise.
- The refreshed-install 10-minute mode `18` soak on `mm-rage` reports `elapsed_ms=600001`, `reports=9`, `frames=192036`, `commands=192036`, `route_commands=192036`, `route_failures=0`, `route_goal_assignments=4889`, `item_goal_assignments=1451`, `item_goal_reservation_skips=3455`, `item_goal_active_reservations=1`, `item_goal_peak_active_reservations=2`, `stuck_detections=11789`, `stuck_recovery_activations=11789`, `recovery_command_uses=72066`, `skipped_inactive=0`, and `pass=1`.
- Eight-bot mode `17` regression still reports `frames=92`, `commands=92`, `route_failures=0`, `item_goal_active_reservations=8`, `item_goal_peak_active_reservations=8`, and `pass=1` after the soak harness changes.
- Implementation log: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-soak-frame-command-smoke-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav map-change repeat smoke slice:

- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke 19` now runs an eight-bot route-command proof, queues `gamemap` for the current map, waits for a new `sv.spawncount`, and repeats the proof after reload.
- `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke_map_repeat_cycles` defaults to `2` and clamps to `2..8`; `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke_map_repeat_reload_timeout_ms` defaults to `10000` and clamps to `1000..120000`.
- Mode `19` emits cycle begin, cycle status requested/complete, reload queued, reload observed, timeout, cleanup, failure, and completion markers so tools can validate each phase without scraping ambiguous game chatter.
- The refreshed-install mode `19` smoke on `mm-rage` reports cycle 1 `frames=92`, `commands=92`, `route_failures=0`, `item_goal_peak_active_reservations=8`, `pass=1`; reload observed in `61` ms; cycle 2 `frames=184`, `commands=183`, `route_failures=0`, `item_goal_peak_active_reservations=8`, `pass=1`; final `cycles=2`, `map_changes=1`, `final_count=0`, and no `commandMsec underflow`.
- The follow-up lifecycle proof adds `sv_bot_frame_command_smoke_map_repeat_restart`, default `0`. When enabled, mode `19` uses `map "<current map>" force` instead of `gamemap`, reports `command=map_force restart=1`, reports `realtime_reset=1` when the forced restart resets `svs.realtime`, and gates cleanup with `q3a_bot_frame_command_smoke_map_repeat_cleanup_status ... count=0 active_reservations=0 pass=1`.
- Restart validation on `mm-rage` passed three proof cycles with two forced restart transitions, all cycle status checks `pass=1`, all cleanup checks `count=0 active_reservations=0 pass=1`, final `cycles=3`, `map_changes=2`, `final_count=0`, and no `commandMsec underflow`. The default `gamemap` path still passes with `command=gamemap restart=0`, two cycles, one map change, and final count zero.
- Mode `17` regression still reports eight active item reservations, zero route failures, and `pass=1`.
- Implementation logs: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-map-change-repeat-smoke-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-map-restart-lifecycle-smoke-2026-06-18.md`.

2026-06-18 nav natural movement and interaction retry slice:

- `bot_nav.*` and `bot_brain.cpp` now report `q3a_bot_nav_natural_support_status` for natural `TRAVEL_CROUCH`, `TRAVEL_SWIM`, and `TRAVEL_WATERJUMP` support in the loaded AAS.
- Current packaged `mm-rage.aas` reports `natural_movement_support_aas_loaded=1`, `natural_movement_support_checks=3`, `natural_movement_supported=0`, `natural_movement_unsupported=3`, with per-type unsupported flags for crouch, swim, and waterjump.
- The natural-support status now also reports an unsupported bitmask, per-type reason codes, resolved AAS area/goal-area pairs, and route-start origins when a reference map provides a matching natural route. On `mm-rage`, the new fields intentionally report unsupported reason data and zero areas/origins for crouch, swim, and waterjump.
- First-pass interaction retry telemetry now covers mover/platform/door/button/trigger candidates, with wait/use command accounting; the elevator proof reports `nav_interaction_activations=1`, `nav_interaction_elevator_activations=1`, `nav_interaction_wait_frames=8`, `nav_interaction_use_frames=8`, `interaction_wait_command_uses=8`, and `interaction_use_command_uses=8`.
- Interaction diagnostics now include a separate context line for visible world interaction candidates by type, including doors, buttons, platforms, trains, water volumes, triggers, movers, and use/touch-capable entities.
- Forced crouch and swim smokes still report `movement_state_crouch_commands=17` and `movement_state_swim_commands=17` with `pass=1`.
- Natural crouch/swim/waterjump runtime proof now needs reference AAS maps with nonzero crouch, swim, and water-jump travel counts.
- Implementation logs: `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-movement-door-retry-2026-06-18.md`, `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-nav-natural-interaction-diagnostics-2026-06-18.md`.

Exit criteria:

- Bots can move from spawn to several item goals on `q2dm1` without manual waypoints.
- Movement looks like Q2 player movement rather than a Q3 movement transplant.
- Failed navigation reports enough detail to fix the generator or runtime.

## Phase 9: Validation, Performance, and Release Packaging

Primary tasks: `DV-03-T05`, `FR-04-T16`, `DV-05-T05`

Goal: keep bots shippable rather than "works on one map."

Validation checklist:

- [ ] Build:
  - [ ] Windows local build.
  - [ ] Linux CI build once CI coverage exists.
  - [ ] macOS CI build once CI coverage exists.
  - [ ] Dedicated server build.
- [ ] Tool:
  - [x] `worr_q2aas` builds.
  - [x] WORR/Q2 generator cfg smoke target runs.
  - [x] Staged map structural AAS smoke emits `.tmp/q2aas/mm-rage.aas`.
  - [x] Staged map strict reachability smoke passes for `.install/basew/maps/mm-rage.bsp`.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target writes `.tmp/q2aas/validation-report.json`.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target writes `.tmp/q2aas/mm-rage.aas.meta.json`.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target requires Q2 `IBSP` version 38 input.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target reports spawn/item origin coverage, high-value pickup reachability, brush contents, and mover/trigger inventory.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target fails on clean BSP lump, spawn coverage, item coverage, and high-value pickup reachability regressions.
  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target fails on structural AAS metric and travel-count regressions below manifest minima.

  - [x] Manifest-driven staged smoke target rejects malformed archive-backed map entries before conversion.
  - [x] Manifest-driven stage target writes validated `.install/basew/maps/mm-rage.aas` and `.tmp/q2aas/stage-report.json`.
  - [x] Manifest-driven stage audit target validates staged `.aas` path, size, and hashes against `.tmp/q2aas/stage-report.json`.
  - [x] Package map smoke target validates pkz archive extraction and conversion using a scratch packaged `mm-rage.bsp`.

  - [x] Package archive audit target requires the packaged `maps/mm-rage.aas` member and writes `.tmp/q2aas/package-archive-audit-report.json`.
  - [x] Refresh-install workflow supports `--package-q2aas-aas`, re-injects generated AAS after asset packaging, and validates the staged Windows payload.
  - [x] Generic stage validation can require packaged archive members with SHA-256 checks, and refresh-install passes q2aas AAS requirements from the stage report.
  - [ ] Reference maps generate AAS.
  - [x] Invalid BSP inputs fail clearly.
  - [x] AAS metadata receives the source BSP checksum during Q2 bridge generation.
- [ ] Runtime smoke:
  - [x] Server-game module builds with the WORR-native AAS runtime shell.

  - [x] Verify three repeated imported Q3A AAS load/unload cycles report `clean_unloads=3`, `unload_failures=0`, `last_unload_zone_active=0`, `last_unload_hunk_active=0`, and `last_unload_open_files=0` in the lifecycle import harness.
  - [x] Start dedicated server on reference map with real BotLib initialized.
  - [x] Run dedicated self-smoke with `sg_bot_lifecycle_smoke 3` so `mm-rage` loads, reloads once, captures `q3a_lifecycle_clean_unloads=1` during each shutdown, and exits.
  - [x] Verify dedicated team-policy smoke counts bot `gclient_t::sess.team` state through the game module and reports `playing=2`, `spectators=1`, `bots=3` for a three-bot Duel setup.

    - [ ] Add source-side CPU timing counters.
  - [x] Route recomputation rate.
  - [x] Add analyzer comparison guards for mixed scenario names, bot counts, duration sources, and missing duration data.
  - [ ] Visibility trace count.
    - [x] Proposed source-side visibility/PVS/PHS/trace counters and analyzer integration contract.
  - [ ] Memory used by AAS.
  - [ ] High bot count degradation policy.
- [ ] Packaging:
  - [ ] `.install/` refreshed after build.
  - [ ] Generated AAS included or intentionally generated on demand.
  - [ ] Tool binary included only if release policy allows it.
  - [ ] Credit/license files included with distributed source/binaries.

Exit criteria:

- Bots and generated AAS survive normal release packaging and smoke testing.
- Known map failures are tracked with diagnostics, not rediscovered manually.

## Credit and Attribution Policy

The project must maintain full credits as work proceeds. The minimum bar is:

- Preserve original source headers in imported Q3A/BSPC files.
- Add local modification notes with date and scope when files are edited.
- Maintain a source ledger under `docs-dev/`.
- Include `TTimo/bspc`, `bnoordhuis/bspc`, id Software, and file-level contributors discovered from upstream history.
- Keep the ledger updated in the same PR/commit as any imported or substantially adapted file.
- Do not collapse "inspired by" and "copied from" into one bucket. The ledger must distinguish:
  - Direct source import.
  - Heavily modified source derivative.
  - Algorithm/concept reference.
  - Clean WORR-native implementation.
- For external source snapshots, record exact commit hashes and retrieval date.
- For vendored code, include license text in the distributed source tree and release packaging where required.

Recommended ledger columns:

| WORR Path | Upstream Path/URL | Upstream Commit | Use Type | License | Copyright/Header | Contributors | Local Changes | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Q3A BotLib assumes Q3 movement and item rules. | Bots route or fight poorly in Q2 maps. | Treat BotLib as nav/goal infrastructure and build WORR-native Q2 behavior above it. |
| AAS generation fails on Q2R/BSPX map variants. | Bots cannot navigate affected maps. | Add tolerant BSP parsing, checksum metadata, and map-specific diagnostics in Phase 1. |
| Mover/door/elevator reachability is inaccurate. | Bots get stuck in common maps. | Model movers from entity lump and add runtime conditional reachability/stuck recovery. |
| Imported C code spreads globals into sgame. | Long-term maintainability suffers. | Keep imported code quarantined behind adapter APIs. |
| License/provenance is incomplete. | Legal and community trust risk. | Make credit ledger a Definition of Done item for every task. |
| High bot counts spike server frames. | Server performance regression. | Stagger expensive work, add CPU budgets, add perf telemetry before polish. |
| Bots feel unfair. | Poor player experience. | Use perception, reaction, aim noise, and item timer fairness gates. |
| Packaging misses AAS/tool files. | Release works locally but not for users. | Tie `.install/` and package validation into `FR-04-T16`. |

## Final Acceptance Criteria

The Q3A bot port is complete when:

- `worr_q2aas` or equivalent can generate usable AAS for the supported reference map set.
- WORR can load generated AAS and initialize BotLib on map start.
- Bots can be added/removed during a running server.
- Bots can navigate, collect useful items, fight, and recover from common route failures.
- Bots participate correctly in FFA/TDM/CTF and do not break match/vote/map transition flows.
- All new public cvars use `sg_bot_*` unless explicitly documented as imported compatibility controls.
- `.install/` staging and packaging include all required bot/AAS artifacts or a documented generation path.
- Credits, license files, source provenance, implementation logs, user docs, and roadmap task statuses are current.
