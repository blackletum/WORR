# Paired Renderer Performance Capture Contract

Date: 2026-07-15

Task ID: `FR-01-T15`

Status: implemented collection gate and one environment-bound dense inline-BSP
CPU-submission budget. Broader representative-map and GPU budgets remain open.

## Purpose

`tools/renderer_parity/analyze_renderer_perf.py` can now verify that Vulkan and
OpenGL telemetry logs are the exact artifacts from one declared scenario before
it evaluates a performance budget. This prevents a polished-looking mean/p95
ratio from silently comparing different maps, command scripts, driver runs, or
modified log files.

The analyzer remains non-interactive. It reads logs and a JSON manifest only;
it does not launch a client or server.

`tools/renderer_parity/run_renderer_perf_capture.py` is the compliant runtime
collector for the fixed-view smoke scenario. It launches both native renderers
through `win_headless 1`, hashes the full `exec` configuration tree and shared
launch profile, and rejects capture logs that name different active adapters.
Its first result is documented in
`vulkan-paired-fixed-view-telemetry-2026-07-15.md`; it is collection evidence
only, not a performance budget.

## Capture manifest schema

The `--capture-manifest` JSON input uses schema version `1`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "scenario": {
    "id": "stable-scenario-name",
    "fixture_sha256": "<64 lowercase-or-uppercase hex characters>",
    "config_sha256": "<64 lowercase-or-uppercase hex characters>"
  },
  "environment": {
    "hardware_id": "stable GPU/CPU/OS identifier",
    "driver": "display-driver identifier"
  },
  "vulkan": {
    "renderer": "vulkan",
    "log_sha256": "<SHA-256 of the exact VK_STATS log>"
  },
  "opengl": {
    "renderer": "opengl",
    "log_sha256": "<SHA-256 of the exact GL_STATS log>"
  }
}
```

The fixture hash covers the exact map/assets/demo used by both renderers. The
configuration hash covers their shared simulation, resolution, cvar profile,
warm-up, and capture command sequence. Renderer-specific selection belongs in
the two runs but must not change the scenario. The environment fields make a
driver or hardware change visible in retained evidence instead of treating it
as a continuation of an old baseline.

The analyzer validates all required fields and both telemetry file hashes. Its
JSON report retains the scenario and artifact hashes. `--budget` now requires
`--capture-manifest`, so a threshold cannot be reported as a reproducible
acceptance result without this provenance.

## Example

```text
python tools/renderer_parity/analyze_renderer_perf.py \
  --vulkan .tmp/renderer-perf/vulkan.log \
  --opengl .tmp/renderer-perf/opengl.log \
  --capture-manifest .tmp/renderer-perf/capture.json \
  --warmup 30 --min-samples 120 \
  --budget assets/renderer_parity/fr01_renderer_perf_budget.json \
  --json-output .tmp/renderer-perf/report.json
```

`fr01_renderer_perf_bmodel_instances_budget.json` is the first checked-in
budget. It is deliberately narrow: its capture contract pins the scenario,
fixture hash, configuration hash, adapter/CPU/OS identifier, and display
driver. It requires 100 valid-GPU samples for both renderers, holds the native
Vulkan dense-inline-BSP path to draw/upload and CPU mean/p95 ceilings, and
requires Vulkan CPU mean to remain no more than 0.8 times OpenGL for that same
captured workload. It does not make a cross-renderer GPU claim.

The optional `capture_contract` object is validated against the already
hash-checked capture manifest. The optional `vulkan_max` object supplies raw
Vulkan metric ceilings; `vulkan_over_opengl_max` retains ratio limits. This
prevents a different map, command profile, adapter, or driver from silently
passing a machine-specific budget. A future budget must cover valid GPU
samples and both mean/p95 metrics that it claims.

## Headless validation

```text
python -m unittest tools/renderer_parity/test_analyze_renderer_perf.py
```

The tests cover ordinary aggregation, manifest acceptance, and rejection of a
telemetry log changed after its manifest was made. No interactive client window
is launched.
