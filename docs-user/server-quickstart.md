# Server Quickstart

This is the practical setup for hosting a WORR dedicated server without digging
through every cvar first.

## Start a Local Dedicated Server

From `.install/`:

- Windows:

  ```powershell
  .\worr_ded_x86_64.exe +set basedir . +set deathmatch 1 +map q2dm1
  ```

- Linux/macOS:

  ```bash
  ./worr_ded_x86_64 +set basedir . +set deathmatch 1 +map q2dm1
  ```

Published release server packages keep their runtime data and configs under `basew/`.
Local `.install/` builds stage that data under `basew/`.
Keep the package's `licenses/` directory beside the server binaries when copying
or mirroring a release install.

## Recommended Baseline Cvars

```text
set hostname "My WORR Server"
set maxclients 12
set timelimit 20
set fraglimit 50
set allow_download 1
```

## Common Admin Flow

1. Keep a server config in `basew/server.cfg` for published releases, or
   `.install/basew/server.cfg` for a local staged build.
2. Launch with `+exec server.cfg`.
3. Test locally, then open your firewall/router port for WAN play.
4. Watch console logs for bad configs, missing maps, or denied file loads.

## Optional Bot Profiles

For bot-enabled practice servers, start with:

```text
set bot_profile vanguard
set bot_min_players 4
```

Release and staged server installs keep botfiles under `basew/botfiles/` as
loose files beside `basew/pak0.pkz`. Operators can edit those loose files or add
new complete profile families, then reload without restarting:

```text
bot_reload_profiles
addbot vanguard
```

Use [Bot Profiles](bot-profiles.md) for the full operator guide, including
where installed botfiles live, what can be overridden, profile fields, and safe
examples.

## Competitive Match Tools

For voting, MyMap, queued nextmap, map selector, tournament, admin, and match
logging setup, use [Competitive Server Tools](competitive-server-tools.md).

## Troubleshooting

- Server starts then exits: check map name and data path (`basedir`).
- Players cannot join: confirm network port forwarding/firewall rules.
- Wrong gameplay rules: check load order of `+set` arguments and `+exec` configs.

## Need Full Command Coverage?

Use `docs-user/server.asciidoc` for the complete low-level command and cvar reference.
