# Progressive Networking Controls

WORR is introducing its newer snapshot, prediction, event, and lag-compensation
systems in stages. The normal compatibility path remains in charge by default.
You do not need to change any of the controls on this page to join or host a
server.

This guide is for server operators evaluating the new lag-compensation path and
for testers comparing the newer snapshot timeline with the established client
renderer. Features labelled **test only** should not be put into a public
server config yet.

## Safe Defaults and Compatibility

| Control | Default | Normal behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `sv_snapshot_shadow` | `1` | Observe outgoing snapshots without changing the packet sent to a client. |
| `cg_snapshot_timeline_render` | `0` | Keep the established client renderer authoritative. |
| `cl_snapshot_recovery` | `0` | Keep full-snapshot requests on the established legacy invalid-frame path only. |
| `cl_adaptive_input` | `0` | Keep the established `cl_maxpackets` and `cl_packetdup` input-delivery policy. |
| `cl_worr_native_shadow` | `0` | Do not send the client half of the native command-shadow diagnostic. |
| `sv_worr_native_shadow` | `0` | Do not enable the server half of the native command-shadow diagnostic. |
| `g_lag_compensation` | `0` | Trace weapon hits against the current server world. |
| `sg_lag_compensation_debug` | `0` | Do not collect or print rewind diagnostics. |
| `net_impair_enable` | `0` | Do not deliberately damage or delay network traffic. |

Legacy Quake II clients, servers, and demos continue to use their established
packet and presentation paths. If a progressive snapshot, command, or rewind
proof is missing or rejected, WORR falls back to a safe compatible path; it
does not trust a guessed timestamp. Client render promotion also falls back one
entity at a time instead of dropping the whole scene.

The following work is still in progress:

- the native progressive wire envelope is limited to the default-off,
  one-command diagnostic described below; it does not yet carry authoritative
  gameplay traffic;
- canonical event records are audited, but live effects and audio are still
  presented by the established event path;
- client gameplay and weapon prediction are not fully promoted;
- adaptive input pacing is available only as an opt-in evaluation path for the
  existing batched-command transport, not the future native envelope;
- rewind covers historical player bounds for the integrated weapon traces, but
  not moving brush models or the complete projectile, melee, and splash policy
  set; and
- multiplayer load, fairness, demo/spectator, and cross-platform release gates
  are not complete.

For those reasons, snapshot render promotion and historical hit validation
remain explicit opt-ins.

## Native Command Shadow (Developer Diagnostic Only)

`cl_worr_native_shadow` and `sv_worr_native_shadow` enable the client and
server halves of a small native-wire diagnostic. Both default to `0`, and both
endpoints must opt in before connecting. The diagnostic runs only on compatible
NEW-netchan connections.

When enabled successfully, WORR observes at most one input command during each
map or native transport epoch. The normal legacy movement command is still sent,
received, and used for gameplay. This pilot does not improve ping, bandwidth,
prediction, or hit registration, and it does not enable the planned full native
netcode.

For a controlled local or private test, set the server side before accepting the
connection:

```text
set sv_worr_native_shadow 1
```

Set the client side before connecting:

```text
set cl_worr_native_shadow 1
```

These controls apply when a connection is created. Reconnect after changing
either one; changing a value during an existing connection does not reconfigure
that connection. If the peer is incompatible or the diagnostic encounters an
error, it silently drains and falls back while the established command path
continues. With either control left at its default `0`, normal legacy networking
and demo behavior are unchanged.

## Server Snapshot Observation

`sv_snapshot_shadow` controls a server-side copy of the final snapshot endpoint
prepared for each client.

- `1` (default) creates the observation copy.
- `0` disables creation of that copy.

The shadow is not a second packet and does not replace the existing protocol.
Failure to create or update it cannot reject an otherwise valid outgoing
snapshot. Disabling it removes diagnostic and future progressive state only;
it is not a bandwidth or gameplay switch.

Set this cvar before clients connect when you want a clean test. An existing
client's shadow is initialized with its gamestate and can remain allocated
until that peer is reinitialized or disconnects.

## Client Snapshot Timeline

`cg_snapshot_timeline_render` is a non-persistent testing control. It returns to
`0` when the client is restarted.

- `0` — established rendering remains authoritative (default).
- `1` — **audit mode**. Sample the canonical snapshot timeline, compare it with
  established interpolation, and keep the established transform.
- `2` — **promotion mode, test only**. Use a canonical remote-entity transform
  only when it passes the timeline safety checks and matches established
  interpolation within the configured tolerance. Every rejected entity falls
  back independently.

When the canonical snapshot consumer is active, modes `1` and `2` print one
aggregate `cg_snapshot_timeline_render: ...` line per second. They do not print
a line for every entity. The predicted local player is never switched by this
control, and extrapolation is disabled in this stage.

`cg_snapshot_timeline_render_epsilon` sets the largest accepted per-axis origin,
beam-end, or angular difference at the promotion gate. Its default is `0.125`;
values are limited to `0.0001` through `8.0`. Raising it makes the comparison
less strict and is not recommended for ordinary parity testing.

To run a short client-side audit:

```text
cg_snapshot_timeline_render 1
```

Watch the console for parity mismatches, discontinuities, pair failures, and
maximum errors. Return to the normal path with:

```text
cg_snapshot_timeline_render 0
```

Mode `2` is intended only for controlled playtests after mode `1` is clean. It
does not enable canonical effects, audio, or full gameplay prediction.

## Client Full-Snapshot Recovery

`cl_snapshot_recovery` is an archived client opt-in and defaults to `0`.

- `0` — use the established recovery path. An invalid or unavailable delta
  base still makes the client ask for a full snapshot automatically.
- `1` — also allow three consecutive canonical snapshot projection or parity
  failures to request a full snapshot through the existing protocol. Requests
  use bounded bursts and a short cooldown so one fault cannot create an
  unrestricted request loop.

This control does not enable a new wire protocol, and it cannot weaken normal
invalid-frame recovery. It is intended for controlled snapshot-shadow testing
while the wider impairment and long-session release gates remain open.

Use `cl_snapshot_recovery_status` to print the current reason flags, failure
streaks, request generation, burst/cooldown state, applied requests, successful
recoveries, and fallback counters. `cl_snapshot_recovery_debug 1` additionally
prints each arm and applied request; leave it at its default `0` outside a
short investigation.

Use `cl_snapshot_shadow_status` to check the underlying canonical snapshot
audit directly. A healthy connected session reports an active shadow, live
projection and comparison counts, and zero parity mismatches. The command is
diagnostic only: it does not enable rendering, recovery, or a new protocol.

## Adaptive Input Delivery

`cl_adaptive_input` is an archived client opt-in and defaults to `0`.

- `0` — keep the established `cl_maxpackets` pacing and `cl_packetdup` backup
  policy.
- `1` — on the existing batched-command path, evaluate recent loss, RTT change,
  queued input, acknowledgement backlog, and the configured rate to select a
  bounded send interval and preserve or raise the configured number of previous
  command batches within the existing transport limit.

The controller does not change the non-batched three-command compatibility
path, does not enable a new protocol, and never changes which command identity
the server acknowledges. A `cl_maxpackets` value of `0` remains unlimited.
Invalid observations fall back locally to the established policy.

Use `cl_adaptive_input_status` to print the current interval, redundancy, loss,
RTT/jitter estimate, queue pressure, reason flags, and fallback counters. This
control remains for evaluation while impairment, bandwidth, correction, and
native-adapter gates are completed.

## Historical Player Hit Validation

`g_lag_compensation` is the compatibility master switch in the server game
module:

- `0` — use current-world collision (default and current release-safe choice);
- `1` — allow the historical player-bounds path for eligible deathmatch weapon
  traces.

The current integration covers machinegun, chaingun, shotgun, super shotgun,
railgun, disruptor convergence, plasma beam, and thunderbolt player traces.
Bots are not treated as rewound shooters. Static world and current non-player
collision remain authoritative, and moving brush-model history is not yet
included. If command authority, timing, player history, or a complete frozen
player scene cannot be proven, the query uses current-world collision.

The supporting policy controls are:

| Control | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `sg_lag_compensation_max_ms` | `200` | Maximum historical window. It is limited to `0..250` ms; `0` prevents historical rewind even when the master switch is on. |
| `sg_lag_compensation_interp_ms` | `-1` | Additional interpolation allowance. `-1` derives it from the estimated snapshot interval; a non-negative value supplies an explicit allowance limited by `sg_lag_compensation_max_ms`. |
| `sg_lag_compensation_legacy_error_ms` | `50` | Largest accepted error bound for a legacy packet-shared time mapping, limited to `0..250` ms. Lower values fail closed more readily. |
| `sg_lag_compensation_debug` | `0` | Diagnostic level described below. |

Debug levels are cumulative:

- `0` — no aggregate diagnostics, trace timing, authority fingerprinting, or
  observation journal writes.
- `1` — print one aggregate `lagcomp: ...` status line per second while the
  trace path is active.
- `2` — also retain a bounded 256-record detailed query journal for diagnostic
  tooling, without printing every query to the console. New records overwrite
  the oldest retained records when the journal is full.
- `3` or greater — also print one detailed `lagcomp trace ...` line for each
  observed query. Use this only for short investigations; busy weapon traces
  can produce substantial console output.

A controlled evaluation config can begin with:

```text
set g_lag_compensation 1
set sg_lag_compensation_max_ms 200
set sg_lag_compensation_interp_ms -1
set sg_lag_compensation_legacy_error_ms 50
set sg_lag_compensation_debug 1
```

Test every enabled ruleset and weapon mix before considering broader use. To
return immediately to current-world collision:

```text
g_lag_compensation 0
sg_lag_compensation_debug 0
```

Historical hit validation is still default-off because its full fairness,
abuse, moving-geometry, sustained-load, and multi-platform release evidence is
not complete.

## Deliberate Network Impairment (Developer Test Only)

The `net_impair_*` controls deliberately delay, drop, duplicate, reorder, or
corrupt traffic for repeatable lab tests. They are not connection-tuning
options. Never enable them on an active public server or on a client whose
connection you need to preserve.

All impairment cvars are non-persistent. Changing a profile parameter clears
queued test packets and restarts the deterministic streams. The same seed and
traffic pattern are intended to reproduce the same impairment decisions.

| Control | Default | Range / purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `net_impair_enable` | `0` | `0` or `1`; master test switch. |
| `net_impair_seed` | `1` | Deterministic 32-bit seed. |
| `net_impair_latency_ms` | `0` | `0..2000` ms one-way base delay. |
| `net_impair_jitter_ms` | `0` | `0..2000` ms signed jitter range. |
| `net_impair_loss_pct` | `0` | `0..100` percent independent loss. |
| `net_impair_burst_loss_pct` | `0` | `0..100` percent burst-start chance. |
| `net_impair_burst_length` | `3` | `1..64` packets in a burst. |
| `net_impair_reorder_pct` | `0` | `0..100` percent extra-hold/reorder chance. |
| `net_impair_duplicate_pct` | `0` | `0..100` percent duplicate chance. |
| `net_impair_corrupt_pct` | `0` | `0..100` percent deterministic one-bit corruption chance. |
| `net_impair_upstream_stall_ms` | `0` | `0..2000` ms extra delay for sequenced client-to-server datagrams. |
| `net_impair_rate_kbps` | `0` | `0..1000000` kbit/s; `0` disables test throttling. |
| `net_impair_queue_limit` | `1024` | `1..1024` active delayed-packet slots. |

A small local latency test looks like this:

```text
net_impair_seed 12345
net_impair_latency_ms 50
net_impair_jitter_ms 10
net_impair_enable 1
net_impair_status
```

Disable the link model and clear its queued packets and counters when finished:

```text
net_impair_enable 0
net_impair_reset
```

`net_impair_status` prints the active profile, queue occupancy, high-water
mark, resets, overflow, and feature counters. `net_impair_reset` clears queued
packets and restarts the current deterministic profile. The
`net_impair_queue_selftest` command is an engine-development invariant test,
not a playtest command; it intentionally fills the configured synthetic queue
and raises a fatal error if the invariant fails.

## What to Include in a Test Report

When reporting a progressive networking issue, include:

- client and server build identifiers and operating systems;
- protocol selected, map, ruleset, player count, and whether a demo was being
  recorded or played;
- the exact values of the controls changed from their defaults;
- relevant `cg_snapshot_timeline_render:`, `cl_snapshot_shadow_status`,
  `cl_snapshot_recovery_status`,
  `lagcomp:`, `lagcomp trace`, or `net_impair_status` output; and
- a short reproduction sequence, including the weapon and whether a mover,
  teleport, death/respawn, or reconnect was involved.

Do not include passwords, private addresses, authentication tokens, or other
secrets in a public report.
