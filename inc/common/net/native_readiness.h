 * epoch/capability/nonce binding and declares that the client has likewise
 * canceled all of its older retained work before emitting the response.  An
 * adapter must satisfy that client-side precondition before calling
 * ClientObserveChallengeV1.  This pointer-free core validates and repeats the
 * declarations but cannot perform adapter-owned cancellation.  Exact
 * duplicates only reassert the same barrier and do not start a new lifecycle.
 *
 * A binding containing NATIVE_ENVELOPE_V1, NATIVE_EVENT_STREAM_V1, and
 * NATIVE_EPOCH_CANCEL_V1 opts into the extended transition chain:
 *   CHALLENGE -> CLIENT_READY -> SERVER_ACTIVE -> CLIENT_ACTIVE_CONFIRM.
 * The server remains in SERVER_WAIT_CLIENT_ACTIVE_CONFIRM until the exact
 * fourth record is accepted.  Native server RX is safe in that wait phase so
 * an application hook can admit DATA appended to the same packet as the
 * reliable confirmation; native server TX stays closed.  Existing bindings do
 * not enter that phase and retain the original three-record behavior.
 *
 * Every mutable object, input record, and output record must be pairwise
 * disjoint.  Invalid arguments/aliasing leave all objects untouched.  A valid
 * but corrupt, out-of-order, or binding-mismatched peer record makes failure
 * sticky and leaves outputs untouched.  Exact duplicates are idempotent;
 * duplicate CHALLENGE/CLIENT_READY observations reproduce the exact response
 * so a lost response can be retried without reopening the state transition.
