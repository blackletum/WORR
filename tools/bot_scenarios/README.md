# Bot Scenario Smokes

Lightweight local harness for WORR Q3A BotLib scenario validation. It wraps existing dedicated-server smoke modes, parses `q3a_bot_frame_command_status`, and can emit text, JSON, Markdown, and comparison reports.

For implementation history and validation notes, see `docs-dev/q3a-botlib-scenario-smoke-harness-2026-06-18.md`.

## Requirements

- Python 3 standard library only.
- For catalog/report/test-only commands: no game launch is required.
- For implemented scenario runs: `.install/worr_ded_x86_64.exe` and packaged `basew` / `mm-rage` assets must exist, usually after a refreshed install.
- `profile_backed_spawn` also requires a staged smoke profile asset resolvable as `smoke`, normally `.install/basew/botfiles/bots/smoke_c.c`. The harness does not create profile assets.
- Reports and stdout/stderr artifacts are written under `.tmp/bot_scenarios/` by default.

## Quickstart

List known scenarios:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --list
```

Run the implemented smoke suite:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario implemented --timeout 120 --base-port 28000 --format text --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json
```

`implemented` runs the default short suite and skips manual long-running scenarios. Use an explicit scenario name or tag for long soaks.

Run one scenario:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario spawn_route_to_item --timeout 60
```

Run the manual high-bot degradation soak:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario high_bot_soak_degradation --timeout 720 --base-port 28000 --format text --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\high_bot_soak_report.json --markdown-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\high_bot_soak_report.md
```

When a scenario degradation policy names JSON budgets under `tools/bot_perf/`, the scenario runner evaluates those budgets after the dedicated-server smoke completes. The JSON result includes the primary/default compact `perf_budget` block plus a `perf_budgets` array for every evaluated lane, including the stricter current-source high-bot budget when `high_bot_soak_degradation` runs.

Run only pending placeholders without launching the game:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario pending --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\pending_report.json
```

Audit whether the remaining movement gap rows can be promoted from
expected-blocked to accepted map-backed proof:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\audit_movement_reference_gaps.py --q2aas-report .tmp\q2aas\validation-report.json --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\movement_reference_gap_audit.json --markdown-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\movement_reference_gap_audit.md
```

This audit reads q2aas reference-feature readiness plus the current bot scenario
catalog. It reports each movement reference gap as blocked, ready for
promotion, or accepted. `worr_crouch_ref` now accepts natural crouch traversal,
and optional `q2dm7` plus `fact2` keep the slime/lava/runtime hazard rows
accepted when those local Quake II BSPs are staged.

Manual long-running:

- `high_bot_soak_degradation`: mode `18`, ten-minute eight-bot soak. Select it by name or with `--scenario soak`; it is omitted from `--scenario implemented` so the default suite stays fast.

Pending placeholders:

- None in the default catalog after the 2026-06-22 FFA live-pacing round.

Pending rows are reported but do not fail the suite unless `--fail-on-pending` is passed. With the current catalog, `--scenario pending` is a no-launch empty report unless new future rows are added.

## Catalog

Emit the declarative scenario catalog:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --catalog --format json --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\catalog_report.json
```

Catalog entries include scenario status, task IDs, smoke mode, runtime budget, manual-only status, selection tags, required status metrics, marker metrics, degradation policy metadata, extra cvars, and pending blockers.

When pending catalog rows exist, they also include planned source smoke modes, promotion-required metrics, and promotion check criteria. Those fields describe the counters and pass/fail values a future source-backed smoke must satisfy before the placeholder can become an implemented scenario.

## Optional Status Fields

The harness tolerates and reports newly added status fields without making them hard gates. Scenario JSON rows include `optional_fields` when matching metrics appear in the selected `q3a_bot_frame_command_status` line or optional marker streams such as `q3a_bot_action_status`.

Current optional discovery families:

- `action_dispatch_counters`: weapon/inventory command-request build, accept/reject, dispatch, defer, submit, failure, carried-weapon inventory scan, ammo-skip, splash-safety, range-selection, estimate-selection, and selected-weapon metadata counters from `q3a_bot_action_status`.
- `live_combat_firing_counters`: enemy acquisition, combat evaluation, fire/withhold, attack-button, and damage proof counters.
- `aim_policy_counters`: aim/fairness policy evaluation, allow/block, live-aim consumer, projectile lead, and last-policy metadata when combat status owners expose it.
- `special_item_utility_buckets`: special item candidate, seek-decision, boost, and last-kind buckets for powerups, techs, mobility, protection, invisibility, and CTF objective pickups.
- `item_timer_fairness_signals`: item-timer fairness observation, allowance/block, fuzzing, timing-policy details, timing-consumer details, and last-timer metadata. When `item_timing_consumer_ready` or `item_timing_consumer_live_pickups` is present, the parser also reports `item_timing_consumer_ready_or_live` as a derived ready/live proof.
- `route_target_stabilization_counters`: route-target stabilization checks, applications, skips, and last sampled target metadata from frame-command status.
- `trace_checked_corner_cutting_signals`: trace-checked corner-cut candidate, trace, accept/reject, and last-corner metadata.
- `team_mode_readiness_signals`: team-policy, objective role/lane, and blackboard team-role signals used by FFA/TDM/CTF/coop readiness work.
- `mymap_match_flow_signals`: bot-attributed MyMap request, queue counts, and queued-map consumption status from match-flow MyMap smoke.

These fields are visible in text, JSON, Markdown, and pending-gap reports when present. They do not satisfy or fail scenario gates unless a scenario explicitly promotes one of them into `checks` or `marker_checks`.

## High-Bot Degradation Policy

High bot count validation is split between a fast pressure proof and an opt-in soak:

- `multi_bot_reservation` is the short eight-bot pressure gate. It does not allow degradation: all eight bots must emit commands, route commands must stay clean, and item reservation pressure must reach eight active reservations.
- `high_bot_soak_degradation` is the long eight-bot degradation gate. It allows final item reservation occupancy and peak reservations to drop below the short proof because long soaks consume, hide, clear, and reassign goals over time. It still requires sustained command throughput, sustained route commands, zero route failures, zero invalid route slots, no inactive target bots, and regular soak progress reports.
- The long soak enables `bot_controlled_inactive_recovery=1` so dead-but-still-playing bots emit controlled respawn commands instead of creating transient inactive-frame failures during normal FFA deaths. Spectator loss and sustained command loss remain failures.
- Derived per-bot/sec budget thresholds remain owned by `tools/bot_perf/default_soak_budget.json`; the scenario harness evaluates that budget through the perf analyzer, records the compact primary `perf_budget` result, and fails the scenario if required derived thresholds fail.
- Current-source soak telemetry is owned by `tools/bot_perf/source_counter_soak_budget.json`; the scenario harness evaluates it as an additional `perf_budgets` lane for `high_bot_soak_degradation`. That strict lane requires all current source-counter groups plus current CPU, route, memory, visibility, and entity-trace derived metrics.
- Source-counter groups remain visible in every budget result: `source_counter_status`, `source_counter_groups_present`, `source_counter_groups_missing`, and `missing_current_counter_count` show whether CPU, route, visibility, trace, entity trace, and memory counter families were present in the long-soak artifact.

## Pending Gap Reports

Analyze an existing JSON report, usually `.tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json`, to see which pending scenario rows and source counters are still missing:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario pending --pending-gap-report .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json --format text --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\pending_gap_report.json
```

This command does not launch the game. It compares pending placeholders against the report fixture and prints whether each scenario is ready for harness promotion or blocked by missing scenario rows, wrong smoke modes, pending fixture rows, absent status/marker metrics, absent policy-consumer evidence, or failed promotion metric checks. After modes `20` through `75`, `trace_checked_corner_cutting`, `coop_match_readiness`, `coop_leader_route`, `coop_progress_wait`, and `coop_interaction_retry` were promoted, the default pending set is empty.

Raw reserved-mode logs can be included when reserved modes have been run outside the normal scenario catalog:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario pending --pending-gap-report .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json --pending-gap-raw-log .tmp\bot_scenarios\raw_modes --format text --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\pending_gap_with_raw_modes.json
```

`--pending-gap-raw-log` accepts a file or directory and may be repeated. The parser groups logs by `q3a_bot_frame_command_smoke_scenario=begin`, then reads the latest `q3a_bot_frame_command_status`, `q3a_bot_blackboard_status`, `q3a_bot_action_status`, `q3a_bot_objective_status`, and `q3a_bot_source_counter_status` markers for that reserved run. If repeated diagnostics exist for one reserved mode, the latest parsed run for that mode is the promotion source. Raw diagnostics can satisfy marker/metric presence in the gap report, but the scenarios remain pending until the real runtime counters pass their promotion checks.

When the same metric appears on more than one raw marker inside a reserved run, the later log line wins. Gap reports also include `missing_metric_sources` so absent promotion counters identify the raw status marker that should emit them, for example `item_health_pickups<-q3a_bot_action_status`. Policy scenarios additionally include `missing_policy_consumer_fields` so absent live-aim or item timing-consumer markers are visible without reading every marker check by hand.

Additional promoted rows reuse existing smoke coverage:

- `trace_checked_corner_cutting`: mode `21`, using the existing switch-weapon reserved smoke because it produces deterministic route corner-cut trace and acceptance telemetry.
- `map_restart_cleanup`: mode `19`, with extra cvar `bot_frame_command_smoke_map_repeat_restart 1`, so the existing map-repeat smoke runs the forced restart path and validates restart cleanup markers.
- `warmup_bot_start_readiness`: `bot_warmup_smoke 2`, so the warmup smoke reports `q3a_bot_warmup_status` before and after cleanup while validating the bot-only `match_start_no_humans` path.
- `vote_bot_exclusion`: `bot_vote_smoke 2`, so the vote smoke reports `q3a_bot_vote_status`, tries a harmless bot-origin `random 2` vote through the game vote helper, and requires the explicit `bot_blocked` rejection path.
- `admin_bot_privilege_audit`: `bot_admin_audit_smoke 2`, so the admin audit smoke reports `q3a_bot_admin_audit_status`, temporarily grants a bot admin session state, attempts `lock_team red`, requires `reason=bot_admin_blocked`, and verifies `red_locked=0` after cleanup.
- `tournament_bot_veto_exclusion`: `bot_tournament_smoke 2`, so the tournament smoke reports `q3a_bot_tournament_status`, assigns the bot the active home-side veto identity, attempts a veto pick, requires `reason=bot_blocked`, and verifies `picks=0` and `bans=0` after cleanup.
- `tournament_replay_reset`: `bot_tournament_smoke 3`, so the tournament smoke seeds a completed best-of-three history, requires an out-of-range replay to preserve state with `reason=range_error`, then replays game 2 and verifies `games_played=1`, one retained winner/map/id, reopened series state, and `reset_applied=1`.
- `match_logging_schema`: `bot_matchlog_smoke 2`, so the match logging smoke builds sample artifacts through the native JSON exporters and requires `worr.match_stats` / `worr.tournament_series` schema metadata plus retained array shape, then verifies the `worr.match_catalog` downstream index contract.
- `mapvote_bot_exclusion_transition`: `bot_mapvote_smoke 2`, so the map-vote smoke reports `q3a_bot_mapvote_status`, begins the native selector on the staged current map, proves a bot ballot is blocked with zero counted votes, finalizes, observes reload, and validates final cleanup.
- `coop_match_readiness`: mode `3`, with extra cvars `deathmatch 0` and `coop 1`, so the existing frame-command smoke reports `q3a_bot_coop_readiness_status pass=1`.
- `coop_leader_route`: mode `3`, with extra cvars `deathmatch 0` and `coop 1`, so the existing frame-command smoke reports `coop_leader_route_*` route-owner counters on both the verbose frame-command marker and compact coop command marker.
- `coop_progress_wait`: mode `3`, with extra cvars `deathmatch 0`, `coop 1`, and `bot_coop_progress_wait 1`, so the existing frame-command smoke reports `coop_progress_wait_*` command-owner counters and WaitForLeader objective policy telemetry.
- `coop_interaction_retry`: mode `12`, with extra cvars `deathmatch 0`, `coop 1`, and `bot_coop_interaction_retry 1`, so the existing elevator route smoke reports `coop_interaction_retry_*` command-owner counters plus route interaction context telemetry.

There are currently no default pending scenarios. Future pending rows should only be added when a new behavior has a concrete promotion contract and a known source-owned status surface.

For `health_armor_pickup`, generic `item_goal_*`, `last_item_goal_*`, and `last_failed_goal_*` status metrics are surfaced as related telemetry when present. They do not satisfy the health/armor promotion gate by themselves; the gate still requires health/armor-specific boost, assignment, pickup, and delta counters.

## Markdown And Comparison Reports

Write JSON and Markdown for a run:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario implemented --timeout 120 --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json --markdown-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.md
```

Compare a current report with a previous JSON report:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py --scenario pending --json-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\pending_compare_report.json --markdown-out .tmp\bot_scenarios\pending_compare_report.md --compare .tmp\bot_scenarios\latest_report.json
```

The comparison is name-based and reports status changes plus selected key metric deltas. It is intended as a quick local regression aid, not a statistical trend analyzer.

## Tests

Run offline parser/reporting tests:

```powershell
python tools\bot_scenarios\test_run_bot_scenarios.py
```

The tests use only the Python standard library. If `.tmp/bot_scenarios/latest_report.json` exists, they also validate key real-report scenario outcomes, including `map_change_repeat` when present. If the fixture is missing, that fixture check is skipped.

Compile-check the harness:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tools\bot_scenarios\run_bot_scenarios.py tools\bot_scenarios\test_run_bot_scenarios.py
```
